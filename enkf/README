COMPILING

EnKF-C is developed for GNU/Linux platform.

Create "make.inc" for your architecture (have a look at examples in `arch'
directory), then run "make". This should create executables bin/enkf_prep,
bin/enkf_calc and bin/enkf_update.

DEPENDENCIES

clang or gcc
openmpi
libnetcdf
liblapack (or better the Intel's version -- libmkl_rt)

USER MANUAL

See doc/enkf-userguide.pdf.

STARTING UP

Run example 1 - see examples/1/README for details.

INDENTING

To indent your code according to the EnKF-C style you need to (1) get modified
version of indent by downloading https://github.com/sakov/enkf-c/releases/download/data/indent-2.2.8a-mod.tar.gz and (2) run "make indent" in this (enkf-c/trunk/enkf) directory (the style is encoded in .indent.pro).
