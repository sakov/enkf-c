v. 1.85.7
   -- A few relatively minor changes in reader_cmems_standard(),
      reader_xy_gridded(), and reader_xyz_gridded(), some log related, others
      qcflag handling related.
v. 1.85.6
   PS 06092018
   -- Corrected descroiption of the reader in the header of reader_cmems.c.

      kind in the file.
v. 1.85.4
   PS 05092018
   -- Corrected defect in calculating the num,ber of unique locations in

v. 1.84.11
   PS 30082018
   -- Updated ncw.[ch] to v2.21.0.
v. 1.84.10
   PS 29082018
   -- Modified das_setnmem() to exit with error if the detected ensemble size is
      less than the specified one.
   -- Some trivial changes in stringtable.[ch].
v. 1.84.9
   PS 24082018
   -- Passed corrections made in v1.83.15 in reader_xy_gridded.c to
      reader_xyz_gridded.c.
v. 1.84.8
   PS 17082018
   -- Added another barrier in enkf_calc.c::main(). Thanks to Paul Sandery for
      the bug report.
v. 1.84.7
   PS 16082018
   -- Added a barrier in das_calcinnandspread() that is supposed to fix a
      rarely (but consistently when it does) manifested defect with HE_VIASHMEM.
      Thanks to Roger Scott for the bug report.
v. 1.84.6
   PS 16082018
   -- Moved the barrier introduced in v1.84.4 to a (hopefully) better position.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.5
   PS 15082018
   -- Modified st_add() to handle the recent replacement st_add_ifabsent() by
      st_add() + check (which is more robust, I guess) in obs_read(): it now
      simply returns (not quits) if the existing entry has the same ID as the
      requested ID.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.4
   PS 15082018
   -- Put a barrier in enkf_calc.c::main() that is supposed to fix occasional
      HDF errors.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.3
   PS 14082018
   -- Fixed (I hope) a defect in das_writevcorrs() sometimes manifested in
      segfaults.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.2
   PS 14082018
   -- Fixed reading of products and instruments from "observations.nc" in
      obs_read(). (This defect was probably hanging from 1.83.10.)
v. 1.84.1
   PS 13082018
   -- Fixed defect introduced in v1.83.14.
      Thanks to Roger Scott and Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.0
   PS 13082018
   -- find_files(): merged pull request by Hugo Oliveira (to allow opendap
      access).
v. 1.83.15
   PS 07082018
   -- Fixed 2 defects in regard to qcflag in reader_xy_gridded(). Thanks to Hugo
      Oliveira for drawing attention.
v. 1.83.14
   PS 03082018
   -- A fix in enkf_calc() that prevents of processes other than rank = 0 write
      the modified errors to observations.nc.
   -- A cosmetic change in das_writeinflation().
v. 1.83.13
   PS 02082018
   -- Fixed defects in regard to qcflag in reader_xy_gridded(). Thanks to Hugo
      Oliveira for raising suspicion.
   -- Updated ncw.[ch] to v2.20.0.
v. 1.83.12
   PS 30072018
   -- Another correction to obs_read().
v. 1.83.11
   PS 30072018
   -- Corrected obs_read() to take care of the recently added attribute
      "long_name" for some variables.
   -- Corrected (I hope) the report of the report on subgrid variability in
      PREP.
v. 1.83.10
   PS 27072018
   -- Added "long_name" attribute to variables in observations.nc and
      observations-orig.nc.
v. 1.83.9
   PS 23072018
   -- Modified readfield(), writefield(), read3dfield(), writerow() for
      (hopefully) more robust handling of the fill value and valid range. Not
      expected to have any effect in majority of existing applications.
v. 1.83.8
   PS 20072018
   -- In reader_mmt_standard() -- allow to proceed if no flags TEMP_BLUELINK_QC
      or PSAL_BLUELINK_QC are found.
v. 1.83.7
   PS 16072018
   -- A minor modification in writefield().
v. 1.83.6
   PS 16072018
   -- A minor modification in readfield().
v. 1.83.5
   PS 10072018
   -- A minor but potentially important fix in das_writevcorrs() (it ensures
      that vcorr.nc is created only once).
v. 1.83.4
   PS 06072018
   -- Added QCFLAGNAME and QCFLAGVALS to reader_xy_scattered(),
      reader_xy_gridded(), reader_xyz_gridded(), reader_xyh_gridded().
v. 1.83.3
   PS 05072018
   -- Eliminated enquiry about dimension "nobs" in reader_xy_scattered().
v. 1.83.2
   PS 05072018
   -- Eliminated enquiry about dimension "nobs" in reader_xyz_scattered() (for
      now).
   -- Modified obsprm_read() to enable reading multiple parameter values.
v. 1.83.1
   PS 05072018
   -- Added QCFLAGNAME and QCFLAGVALS to reader_xyz_scattered() (for now).
   -- Added prmfname to struct obsmeta for better error messaging in readers.
v. 1.83.0
   PS 29062018
   -- Modified superob grid so that the centres of superob cells now coincide
      with the nodes of the grid for the corresponding model variable.
      This addresses the "second problem" reported by Hugo Oliveira in
      https://github.com/sakov/enkf-c/issues/5.
v. 1.82.4
   Hugo Oliveira 27062018
   -- Fixed bugs for sigma introduced in v1.81.0.
v. 1.82.3
   PS 26062018
   -- A fix of a defect in ncw_copy_vardef() that often prevented creating
      unlimited dimension.
   -- A few fixes in update.c that make it possible to calculate forecast
      spread without running CALC (note that one needs to comment out point
      log specs in the main parameter file for it).
v. 1.82.2
   PS 25062018
   -- A minor fix in ncw_copy_vardef() to deal with unlimited dimensions.
   -- A minor (supposedly cosmetic) rewrite in traceprod().
v. 1.82.1
   PS 22062018
   Modified ncw_copy_vardef() to handle the case when some of the dimensions
   of the variable being copied already exist in the destination file and have
   different length. This manifested in errors during assembly of spread.nc
   (and, I guess, inflation.nc).
v. 1.82.0
   PS 19062012
   Harmonised specifying LOCRAD in the main parameter file with that in the
   obstypes parameter file. Replaced WEIGHT by LOCWEIGHT.
v. 1.81.2
   PS 18062018
   A bit of clean-up; in particular removed asynchronous entries from struct
   enkfprm, as they belong now to struct obstype.
v. 1.81.1
   PS 18062018
   Cosmetic changes; in particular renamed obsmeta.[ch] to obsprm.[ch].
v. 1.81.0
   PS 15062018
   Modified code for sigma coordinate to permit stretching as described in
   https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Vertical_S-coordinate, Vstretching = 5
   (Vstretching = 2..4 did not require that, and Vstretching = 1 corresponds to
   the "old" stretching function (1) that is not handled in EnKF-C).
v. 1.80.9
   PS 14062018
   Corrected calculation of zt[] in gz_sigma_z2fk() and in grid_fk2z() for
   "g->vtype == GRIDVTYPE_SIGMA" in the case when hc != 0. Thanks to Frank
   Colberg for the bug report and correction.
v. 1.80.8
   PS 12062018
   Cosmetically modified stringtable.[ch].
v. 1.80.7
   PS 12062018
   A few minor changes to make sure that the system runs fine when nobs = 0 (and
   CALC is run with --ignore-no-obs).
v. 1.80.6
   PS 08062018
   A correction in reader_xy_gridded().
v. 1.80.4
   PS 07062018
   Re-wrote das_writecorrs() for better parallelisation.
v. 1.80.3
   PS 07062018
   -- Multiple technical changes. Among substantial ones: it seems that the
      lon/lat coordinate order in reader_xy_gridded() and reader_xyz_gridded()
      has been swapped (i.e. lat was assumed to be the innermost one).
v. 1.80.2
   PS 07062018
   -- Some internal reshuffling, mainly concerning reading/writing of the
      fields, and also of das_writecorrs(), which seems too slow.
v. 1.80.1
   PS 06062018
   -- Added UPDATE option "--calculate-vertical-correlations".
v. 1.80.0
   PS 06062018
   -- Added UPDATE option "--calculate-forecast-spread". This skips calculating
      analysis spread.
v. 1.79.2
   PS 04062018
   -- Trying to work through occasional problems arising when trying to put
      spreads of each variable (normally stored in different files) into common
      "spread.nc". This fix targets a particular MOM feature that creates output
      files with dimension names xaxis_1, yaxis_1, zaxis_1 regardless of those
      of the grids the variables are defined on... Therefore: in
      ncw_copy_vardef() -- do not create outer limited dimensions of size 1.
v. 1.79.1
   PS 01062018
   -- A minor change in model_create() to permit case sensitive grid names.
v. 1.79.0
   PS 30052018
   -- In reader_mmt.c: only use data with TEMP_BLUELINK_QC (for T) or
      PSAL_BLUELINK_QC (for S) = 0.
v. 1.78.0
   PS 21052018
   -- Shifted transform used for updating an observation at (fi, fj) from
      ((int) fi, (int) fj) to ((int) (fi + 0.5), (int) (fj + 0.5)). This is
      supposed to be more consistent, but inpractice makes a very little
      difference.
v. 1.77.1
   PS 09052018
   -- Added an error message in das_setnmem() to print the name of the missing
      model file when nmem = 0.
v. 1.77.0
   PS 03052018
   -- Added capability to limit the number of observations of each type used
      in local analyses via entries NLOBSMAX in the main and obstypes parameter
      files.
v. 1.76.5
   PS 01052018
   -- Removed what supposed to be a check on positive layer thicknesses in
      gz_hybrid_create(), as one needs to run it on the layer coordinates rather
      than on at/ac/bt/bc coefficients, and for that one needs to know the
      (approximate) surface pressure that seems unavailble at that point.
v. 1.76.4
   PS 01052018
   -- Corrected assertions at the end of gz_z_create() and gz_sigma_create() to
      work for 1-layer model (replaced < by <=). Thanks to Paul Sandery for the
      report.
v. 1.76.3
   PS 01052018
   -- Corrected error message in reader_xyh_gridded() -- thanks to Paul Sandery
      for the report.
v. 1.76.2
   PS 30042018
   -- Removed redundant declarations in model.h.
v. 1.76.1
   PS 27042018
   -- Corrected update_HE() and update_Hx() in the case -DHE_VIASHMEM. This is
      a relatively minor correction that should improve calcuation of analysis
      observation stats.
v. 1.76.0
   PS 27042018
   -- Moved specification of ZSTATINTS from the main parameter file to the grid
      parameter file.
      NOTE: this may require update of the existing parameter files.
v. 1.75.0
   PS 27042018
   -- Removed redundant struct obsdomain in enkfprm.h.
v. 1.74.13
   PS 24042018
   -- Corrected defect in distribute_iterations() introduced in v1.74.1
v. 1.74.12
   PS 23042018
   -- das_getHE(): a correction of the ensemble size in the case
      (das->mode == MODE_ENOI && enkf_fstatsonly).
v. 1.74.11
   PS 20042018
   -- A minor correction in update_Hx() and update_HE().
v. 1.74.10
   PS 20042018
   -- A few minor modifications in update_Hx() and update_HE() for faster
      cycling of parallel jobs. Increased HE_NPROCMAX from 10 to 20.
v. 1.74.9
   PS 20042018
   -- Do not moderate observations if observations.nc already contains moderated
      obs. Previously, the moderated obs has not been written in this case, but
      still moderated (for the second time).
v. 1.74.8
   PS 20042018
   -- A minor correction in update_Hx(). A few cosmetic (I think) corrections.
v. 1.74.7
   PS 19042018
   -- Improved gather_St() (hopefully).
v. 1.74.6
   PS 19042018
   -- Improved gathering of HE with -DHE_VIASHMEM. Removed a few barriers.
v. 1.74.5
   PS 19042018
   -- Mainly barriers to work with -DHE_VIASHMEM.
v. 1.74.4
   PS 18042018
   -- A minor correction in update_HE().
v. 1.74.3
   PS 18042018
   -- It seems that MPI_Barrier() is needed before MPI_Allgatherv()...
v. 1.74.2
   PS 18042018
   -- Fixed a defect in the latest version of distribute.c.
v. 1.74.1
   PS 18042018
   -- Limited the number of parallel processes updating HE by
      min(10, nprocesses); otherwhile I/O can become a bottleneck, I think.
v.  v1.74.0
   PS 17042018
   -- Introduced shared memory model for HE in CALC (need to be compiled with
      -DHE_VISHMEM). This is useful for situations when CALC becomes memory
      limited.
   -- Parallelised update_HE() when compiled with -DHE_VIASHMEM.
v. 1.73.1
   PS 10042018
   -- Eliminated an argument in H_fn definition in allhs.h.
v. 1.73.0
   PS 06042018
   -- Using a user defined MPI data type for communicating ensemble obs between
      members rather than MPI_float. This allows to overcome the MPI limit on
      the number of elements (currently 2^31 - 1) that manifests when the number
      of ensemble observations becomes very large (>~ 2.5e8).
   -- A minor modification in enkf_prep to print obs stats when not superobing.
v. 1.72.1
   PS 06042018
   -- A (probably, temporal) fix for a very rarely manifested defect caused by
      the mismatch between the data types used for observation fractional grid
      coordinates when stored in observations.nc (float) and when first
      calculated in data readers (double).
v. 1.72.0
   PS 27032018
   -- Introduced a new parameter EXCLUDEINST in reader_mmt_standard(). Should be
      used as e.g. "PARAMETER EXCLUDEINST = WMO995".
v. 1.71.2
   PS 27032018
   -- A possible bug fix in grid_setlonbase(). A few cosmetic changes in grid.c.
      A minor change in Makefile.

   PS 26032018
   -- A minor modification for Z grids: when ZCVARNAME is specified --
      distinguish cases nkc = nk and nkc = nk + 1.
v. 1.71.0
   PS 26032018
   -- Implemented the "new" ROMS formulation of the vertical sigma coordinate,
      with the associated changes in gridprm.[ch] and grid.c.
v. 1.70.5
   PS 08032018
   -- Eliminated field "nallocated" in struct stringtable.
v. 1.70.4

   -- Eliminated getnumlevels(), which was redundant because of getnlevels().
v. 1.70.3
   PS 08032018

v. 1.70.2
   PS 07032018
   -- In utils.c replaced code borrowed from Jdn_L.C for day difference
      calculation by that from Scaldate.C (see
      http://www.diyspeakers.net/snippets.org/c.snippets.org/browser.html).
v. 1.70.1
   PS 06032018
   -- A minor change in error messages in readfield() and read3dfield().
v. 1.70.0
   PS 06032018
   -- Eliminated readfield() and read3dfield(); renamed readfield2() as
      readfield() and read3dfield2() as read3dfield(); modified the rest of the
      code accordingly. This ensures that the dimensions of the fields read are
      always consistent with the assumed dimensions.
v. 1.69.7

      round-up effects.
v. 1.68.6-dev
   PS 19012018
   -- Allow running CALC twice (I hope), just ignoring the previous stuff.
   -- Made sob_stride grid-dependent. SOBSTRIDE = 0 means no superobing on this
      grid.
   -- Tidied and moved handling of array of grids from model.c to grid.c.
   -- Modified grid_xy2fij(), grid_z2fk(), grid_fk2z() to return meaningful
      status (previously done by model_*()).
   -- Changed format of readers -- replaced model* in the argument list by
      grid*.
   -- Added obstypes_set().
v. 1.68.5-dev

      the associated check to PREP.
   -- Moved calculation of struct observation.model_depth from paticular readers
      to obs_add().
   -- Added island() as an analogue to interpolate2d() used for calculation
      of struct observation.model_depth for situations when there is no depth
      variable defined for a grid.

   -- Changed cycling in reader_xyh_gridded() to make k the fastest index (this
      is supoposed to accelerate fk2z and z2fk conversions).
v. 1.67.0
   PS 03012018
   -- Replaced TODO in obs_create_fromsingleob() by a call to model_fk2z().
v. 1.66.5-dev
   PS 03012018
   -- Implemented grid_fk2z() for GRIDVTYPE_HYBRID.
v. 1.66.4-dev
   PS 03012018
   -- Added a few lacking pieces for hybrid vertical grids.
   -- Modified update_HE() to handle observations on multiple grids.
   -- Updated ncw.c to v2.12 to fix defect in ncw_check_vardims().
v. 1.66.3-dev
   PS 02012018
   -- Added reader_xyh_gridded() for 3D data with hybrid vertical coordinate.
      (Not tested yet.)
v. 1.66.2-dev
   PS 11122017
   -- Fixed a defect in Makefile introduced in r556.
v. 1.66.1-dev
   PS 11122017
   -- Continuing: fixed a lot of silly bugs. This version should work with
      historic settings as long as one does not try using "VTYPE = HYBRID".
v. 1.66.0-dev
   PS 11122017
   -- Started implementing hybrid vertical grid.
v. 1.65.8
   PS 07122017
   -- Corrected instrument string in reader_mmt_standard().
v. 1.65.7
   PS 05122017
   -- Renamed arch/make.inc.linux to arch/make.inc.linux-desktop-lapack, and
      arch/make.inc.mkl to arch/make.inc.linux-server-mkl
v. 1.65.6
   PS 04122017
   -- Cosmetic updates of arch/make.inc.linux and arch/make.inc.mkl.
v. 1.65.5
   PS 27112017
   -- Fixed a defect in get_shift() associated with v1.65.4.
v. 1.65.4
   PS 27112017
   -- Changed specification for edge-aligned asynchronous intervals from "n"
      (for non-centred) to "e" (for edge-aligned).
v. 1.65.3
   PS 24112017
   -- Added checks on dimensions of DEPTH and NLEVELS fields in grid.c.
v. 1.65.2
   PS 24112017
   -- Introduced option "non-centred" for the asynchronous time binning
      intervals. By default the interval 0 is centred about the assimilation
      time. When specified as "non-centred" its start considdes with the
      assimilation time.
v. 1.65.1
   PS 14112017
   -- A minor correction in obstypes_read().
v. 1.65.0
   PS 10112017
   -- Added a new option to enkf_prep: "--no-superobing-across-instruments" to
      make it possible to obtain clean stats on each instrument type.
v. 1.64.4
   PS 09112017
   -- In model_adddata() added a check that the field dimension matches the
      the assumed (model) dimension.
v. 1.64.3
   PS 07112017
   -- Included observations outside strictly defined observation window into
      slot "outside" in observation statistics reported by PREP.
v. 1.64.2
   PS 07112017
   -- "ASYNC 0" is now considered as specifying synchronous DA (i.e. is
      equivalent to the absense of this entry).
v. 1.64.1
   PS 07112017
   -- Modified grid_create() to allow z-grids with no depth specified (e.g. for
      atmosphere). `numlevels' is then simply set to the number of layers
      everywhere.
v. 1.64.0
   PS 07112017
   -- Made observation window observation type dependent. The common observation
      main window still can be set from the main parameter file. For a
      particular observation type it can be overwritten in the obstypes
      parameter file.
v. 1.63.4
   PS 01112017
   -- Added a barrier before removing ".enkftmp".
v. 1.63.3
   PS 01112017
   -- Write tiles for pointlog files in directory ".enkftmp" (used to be written
      in the work directory).
v. 1.63.2
   PS 23102017
   -- Corrected VIIRS reader. Now PARAMETER KIND = 1 or PARAMETER KIND = 2 will
      use the nighttime or dayghlight obs only, and PARAMETER KIND = 3 will use
      all observations.
v. 1.63.1
   PS 19102017
   -- Added optional PARAMETER KIND to reader_viirs_standard().
v. 1.63.0
   PS 03102017
   -- Added reader_xyz_scattered.c.
v. 1.62.2
   PS 27092017
   -- Fixed (hopefully) a subtle defect in handling periodic grids. It
      manifested in getting weird longitude values for super-observations when
      the collated obs had fi (fractional i indices) both in [ni - 1, ni - 0.5)
      and [ni - 0.5, ni) intervals. Thanks to Matt Chamberlain and Russ Fiedler
      for the bug report.
v. 1.62.1
   PS 26092017
   -- Added optional parameters VARSHIFT and MINDEPTH to
      reader_viirs_standard().
v. 1.62.0
   PS 21092017

      fields.
v. 1.61.6
   PS 15092017 (actually Russ Fiedler)
   -- Corrected the call to MPI_Allgatherv() in ensobs.c:
      MPI_Allgatherv(das->S[my_first_iteration],...) became
      MPI_Allgatherv(MPI_IN_PLACE,...). It seems that the previous version
      started to work dogy with OpenMPI v1.10.2.
v. 1.61.5
   PS 14092017
   -- Removed redundant reader_aquarius.c and reader_smos.c (these data are now
      handled by reader_xy_gridded.c).
v. 1.61.4
   PS 13092017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded() to allow a record dimension with a single
      record only (for now).
v. 1.61.3
   PS 13092017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded() and reader_xy_scattered() to allow NaNs as
      fill values. Necessary to make it possible to use for reading SMOS data.
v. 1.61.2
   PS 15082017
   -- A minor modification in the observation constructor in CALC.
v. 1.61.1
   PS 15082017
   -- A change to permit variable names in the state vector (defined in the
      model prm file) different by case only, e.g.: t and T, u and U etc.
v. 1.61.0
   PS 15082017
   -- Made STRIDE grid dependent.
v. 1.60.4

v. 1.60.3
   PS 02082017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded.c and reader_xy_scattered.c to allow lack of
      the time variable. Time is assumed then to be at the anaysis time.

   PS 02082017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded.c to handle curvilinear grids.
v. 1.60.1
   PS 07062017
   -- Some minor portability related changes in hash.[ch].
v. 1.60.0
   PS 26052017
   -- Corrected (I hope) the sign of the bias correction in the mixed layer in
      subsurface fields. (It should be the same in H_subsurf_wsurfbias() and
      in H_surf_biased().)
v. 1.59.2
   PS 30032017
   -- Introduced and using now str2bool() for reading ISSURFACE entry.
v. 1.59.1
   PS 30032017
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v. 1.59.0
   PS 30032017
   -- Replaced KIND entry in observation types parameter file by ISSURFACE.
v. 1.58.0
   PS 29032017
   -- Added two new entries NCFORMAT and NCCOMPRESSION to the main parameter
      file. Consider it experimental at this stage! The defaults remain
      NC-64BIT_OFFSET and no compression.
v. 1.57.0
   PS 29032017
   -- Changed identification of observation types. Each type now is
      characterised by its "observation kind". Currently there are two kinds
      available: "SURFACE" and "SUBSURFACE". There is no longer "ALIAS" and
      "ISSURFACE" entries for observation types.

      ONE MUST MAKE (RATHER MINOR) CHANGES TO OBSTYPES.PRM FILES WHEN UPDATING
      TO THIS VERSION.
v. 1.56.3
   PS 28032017
   -- Corrected obs_addtype() to initialise the new field `aliasname'.
v. 1.56.2
   PS 28032017
   -- Eliminated H_sla_bran().
v. 1.56.1
   PS 27032017
   -- Added examples/5.
v. 1.56.0
   PS 27032017
   -- Introduced a new optional field "ALIAS" for observation types. This
      allows one to add a new observation type without re-compiling the code.
      This can be useful e.g. for evaluating a new instrument (by getting an
      independent statistics for the new instrument and seeing the change in
      statistics for the old instruments).
v. 1.55.4
   PS 24032017
   -- Added 0.17 to H8 SST to get the foundation temperature.
v. 1.55.3
   PS 23032017
   -- Added parameter INSTRUMENT to reader_xy_gridded() and
      reader_xy_scattered().
v. 1.55.2
   PS 23032017
   -- In reader_xy_gridded() and reader_xy_scattered() added check for attribute
      of the data variable "error_std".
v. 1.55.1
   PS 23032017

      the layer indexing starts from the bottom.
v. 1.46.14
   PS 28092016

   PS 16092016
   -- Cosmetic changes.

   -- On multi-grid model - modified plog_writestatevars_direct() and
     plog_writestatevars_toassemble() to skip writing variables from grids
     other than the native one for a given pointlog (this could try to access
     nodes outside grid and generate segfaults).
v. 1.46.5

      round-off error occuring after writing and reading `fi' to observations.nc
      as a float.
   -- Changed `id_orig' in observations.nc to correspond to the observation
      number as read from data files rather than to the id in
      observations-orig.nc (that is, after compacting).
   -- Changed the type of fields `type', `product' and `instrument' of struct
      observation from int to short int.
v. 1.45.1

      when calculating ensemble spread only.
v. 1.45.0
   PS 16082016

      outside the grid.
v. 1.44.0
   PS 28062016
   -- Added `model_depth' to `struct observation'.
v. 1.43.0
   PS 28062016
   -- Minor structural changes for struct obstype -- now can depend on an
      arbitrary number of model variables specified after the entry VAR in

      surface obs types the observation layer/depth is set to surface
      regardless of the entered value
v. 1.33.0

   -- Added examples/4 to demonstrate a multi-grid setting.
   -- Added examples/1/conf directory to the source. Excluded it from the
      example data download.
   -- Changed some dimension and variable names and deleted global attributes
      in grid_spec.nc files.
v. 1.32.2
   PS 16022016
   -- Beautified examples/2/Makefile
   -- Added examples/3 to demonstrate using masked curvilinear grid in PREP
v. 1.32.1
   PS 16022016
   -- Bug fix for the previous version.
   -- Put in examples/2. It is exactly as example 1 except that the grid is
      set aas curvilinear (although in fact it is rectangular in lon/lat).
v. 1.32.0
   PS 12022016
   Made changes in the grid code to enable handling of ORCA grids. Also
   simplified the structure of the grid code -- got rid of dynamic functions,
   now using simple "if" cycles instead. Added grid_ij2xy() to make it possible
   to get cell's coordinates when necessary without parsing the whole grid into
   a spatial binary tree.

   In regard ORCA grids the workflow is as follows.
   1. Make a complementary grid with masked nodes around two poles in the
      northern hemisphere and along the line connecting these nodes. Run PREP
      with this grid. It will be fully mapped at a cost that a very small
      percent of obs along the line connecting the two poles will be ignored.
   2. Run CALC and POST with the normal grid.
v. 1.31.1
   PS 25012016
   -- Modified section 1.2 of the user guide.
v. 1.31.0
   PS 03012016

   PS 23122015
   -- Added a crude check on individual observations after reading and initial
      processing to avoid situations with zero error or likewise.
v. 1.29.1
   PS 09122015
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v. 1.29.0
   PS 30112015
   -- Modified code to allow arbitrary range for the grid longitude.
      The range is now defined by the grid.lonbase field:
      lon range = [lonbase, lonbase + 360). (Used to be allowed either
      [-180, 180) or [0, 360) only.)
v. 1.28.3
   PS 17112015
   -- Modified gridprm_create() to make sure that the entry NAME is entered
      first when initialising a new grid.
v. 1.28.2
   PS 04112015
   -- Corrected a defect in reading multiple LOCRAD nd WEIGHT entries in
      obstypes parameter file.
v. 1.28.1
   PS 04112015
   -- Added a check on distance in obstype_calclcoeff(), necessary in
      multi-scale case.
v. 1.29.0
   PS 03122015
   Made entries "NUMLEVELSVARNAME" for Z grids or "MASKVARNAME" for sigma grids
   optional. The code builds these arrays now if necessary.
v. 1.28.1
   PS 03122015
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v. 1.28.0
   PS 30112015
   -- Made changes that suppose to make it possible multi-scale localisation.
      For now made it sure the code works with (single scale) example 1.
v. 1.27.4
   PS 28102015
   -- A change in an error message in enkfprm.c.
v. 1.27.3
   PS 28102015
   -- Moved #include "gridmap.h" in grid.c inside "#if !defined(NO_GRIDUTILS)".
      Thanks to Justin Freeman for reporting this defect.

   PS 28102015
   -- Modified all readers to generate an error on unknown parameter.
v. 1.27.1
   PS 28102015
   -- Fixed a few glitches in reader_pathfinder_standard().
v. 1.27.0

   -- Added reader_pathfinder.c.
   -- Added PARAMETER ADDBIAS to reader_navo_standard(); default = no.
   -- Cosmetic changes in readers.
v. 1.26.11
   PS 26102015
   -- Allowed comments (starting with "#") after definition of pointlog in the
      main parameter file.
   -- Made model_getgridbyname() exit with error rather than return NULL when
      no grid with specified name is found.
v. 1.26.10
   PS 20102015
   -- Moved obs_createkdtrees() from the cycle over grids.
v. 1.26.9

      format used.
v. 1.26.8
   PS 15102016
   -- Cosmetic changes (initialisation log).
v. 1.26.7
   PS 15102015
   -- Fixed inconsistency between insert and search keys in ht_plogs.
v. 1.26.6
   PS 15102015
   -- Reversed 1.26.3; instead write the "actual" transform to the point log
      only for if field.id == 0.
v. 1.26.5
   PS 15102015
   -- Corrected a (recently introduced) defect in g2_xy2fij() that filtered
      latitude according to the longitude range (-180 to 180 or 0 to 360).
v. 1.26.4
   PS 15102015
   -- Corrected log printing in model_print().
v. 1.26.3
   PS 14102015
   -- Introduced field pointlog.transform_written to avoid multiple writes of
      the "actual" (interpolated) transforms to pointlog files.
v. 1.26.2
   PS 13102015
   -- Generate error on unknown parameter in observation parameter file.
v. 1.26.1
   PS 13102015
   -- Fixed log when reporting obstypes parameter file (observation parameter
      file was reported instead).
v. 1.26.0
   PS 12102015
   -- Added parameter ORBITS to reader_amsre_standard(). Can be either "ALL",
      "DESCENDING", or "ASCENDING".
v. 1.25.5
   PS 08102015
   -- A similar change in z2fk_basic().
v. 1.25.4
   PS 08102015
   -- Fixed defects in x2fi_irreg() during mapping of points in the last cell.
v. 1.25.3
   PS 06102015
   -- Fixed a potentially major defect in vertical mapping for sigma grids in
      the case of grids going from bottom up. (Somehow it has not show up in
      practice.)
v. 1.25.2
   PS 06102015
   -- Changed INFRATIO_DEFAULT from 0.5 to 1.0.
v. 1.25.1
   PS 29092015
   -- Semi-cosmetic changes.
v. 1.25
   PS 24092015

   -- Introduced alpha -- moderating parameter in DEnKF and ETKF.
v. 1.23.5

      to non-existent observation-orig.nc.
v. 1.23.3
   PS 09092015
   -- Fixed deallocation of null pointer in model.c and added missed
      deallocations in pointlog.c.
v. 1.23.2
   PS 09092015
   -- Cosmetic changes in distribute.c.
v. 1.23.1
   PS 09092015
   -- A minor clean-up of a previous development.
v. 1.23
   PS 08092015
   -- Added a new optional entry PARAMETER to the parameter data file.
      This allows to specify an arbitrary number of parameters for the reader.
      Modified reader_rads_standard() and reader_rads_standard2() to handle
      parameter MINDEPTH.
v. 1.22
   PS 07092015
   -- in find_files() added fflush(stdout) before calling popen() to avoid
      "intermingling" of outputs of the original and fork processes.
   -- Added a section on adaptive moderation of observations ("K-factor") to
      user manual.
v. 1.21.1
   PS 04092015
   -- Changed default to ignore subgrid variability.
v. 1.21
   PS 04092015
   -- During superobing - calculate std of the subgrid variability (in a rather
      crude way) and use <obs error std> = max(<obs error std>, <subgrid std>).
v. 1.20
   PS 03092015
   -- Switched off writing obs to observations-orig.nc when enkf_prep is run
      with --no-superobing.
   -- Corrected indexing of obs. This might be a substantial defect that was
      demonstrated to result in losing superobs in some cases, at least.
v. 1.19.2
   PS 01092015
   -- Fixed inconsistency in handling pointlog hash table.
v. 1.19.1
   PS 01092015
   -- A number of minor follow-on changes to v. 1.19.
v. 1.19
   PS 31082015
   -- Modified code to allow point logs to be specified on any grid by entering
      the grid name as an additional parameter in the pointlog entry. Grid 0
      will still be used as default.
v. 1.18
   PS 31082015
   -- Verified that setting LOCRAD and STRIDE to big numbers results in
      calculating a global analysis. Made some changes to the code to ensure
      that it runs with such setings, even when using more than one CPU in calc.
      Added target "global" to example 1.
v. 1.17
   PS 27082015
   -- Made writing analyses to separate files (rather than appending to forecast
      files) the default action. The former option "--separate-output" became
      redundant, a new option "--joint-analysis" appends analysis to forecast
      files.
v. 1.16
   PS 26082015
   -- Fixed a defect for sigma models resulted only in the first (with zero id)
      layer being updated (not sure when it was introduced).
v. 1.15
   PS 26082015
   -- Added a check on analysis julian day when opening observations.nc (to
      exclude using data from another cycle).
v. 1.14
   PS 25082015
   -- Added option "--point-logs-only" to enkf_calc to complement
      "--no-fields-write" in enkf_update.
v. 1.13
   PS 18082015
   -- Introduced global z intervals used for each region (unless overriden
      by local settings). Also, if no regions defined introduced a default
      region "Global" with domain [x1,x2] = [-999,999], [y1,y2] = [-999,999].
v. 1.12
   PS 17082015
   -- Can now specify arbitrary number of z intervals for obs stats of 3D
      fields for each region. The default is [0 50] [50 500] [500 9999].
v. 1.11
   PS 13082015
   -- Added ability to specify vertical split in observation stats for 3D fields
      for each region (in the region specs in the main parameter file); also
      added stats for the intermediate interval.
v. 1.10
   PS 12082015
   -- Fixed a major slowdown in obs_findlocal() introduced in v. 1.08: moved
      obs_find_bytype() outside. Thanks to Paul Sandery for the report.
v. 1.09.1
   PS 07082015
   -- Fixed bug in invsqrtm2() that resulted in wrong X5 for the ETKF. Thanks
      to Yonghong Yin for the report.
v. 1.09
   PS 04082015
   -- Added a new flag "--use-rmsd-for-obsstats" for enkf_calc. When RMSD is
      printed to the log, "[.]" is shown instead of "|.|" used for printing
      MAD. Also, added printing of the command line and working directory to the
      log for all binaries.
v. 1.08.2
   PS 03082015
   -- Corrected bug in obs_findlocal().
v. 1.08.1
   PS 03082015
   -- Bugs corrected in das_writefields() and obs_addtype().
v. 1.08
   PS 03082015
   -- Modified code to make localisation radius dependent on the observation
      type. The common value can now be overriden for  particular obs. type
      in the observation types parameter file.
v. 1.07
   PS 29072015
   -- Added a new option to enkf_update: --write-inflation. (It only takes
      effect when using adaptive inflation.)
v. 1.06.1
   PS 23072015
   -- Fixed a defect -- checking that plogs do actually exist before working
      on them. Thanks to Paul Sandery for reporting.
v. 1.06
   PS 22072015
   -- Added capability to define the limiting multiple for inflation (remains
      0.5 by default).
v. 1.05
   PS 09072015
   -- Added AMSRE reader.
v. 1.04
   PS 09072015
   -- Eliminated the field `dasystem.target'; it is replaced by the flag
      `das->updatespec & UPDATE_OUTPUTINC'.
v. 1.03
   PS 08072015
   -- Unified specifications for enkf_update -- they are now all in the variable
      `updatespec'.
   -- Introduced a new option in enkf_update "-no-fields-update".
v. 1.02
   PS 22062015
   -- Made land test in das_updatefields() and das_updatebg() depth dependent.
      For now assume that the layeres are counted down from the surface (for Z
      models).
v. 1.01
   PS 18062015
   -- Fixed inconsistency with -DNO_GRIDUTILS (thanks to Russ Fiedler for the
      bug report).
   -- Some cosmetic changes.
v. 1.00
   PS 17062015
   -- Modified code to make the actual (interpolated) transforms/weights also
      written to the pointlog files (as "X5_actual" or "w_actual").
v. 0.99
   PS 16062015
   -- Modified pointlog code to write both analysis and forecast variables (was
      analysis only).
   -- Corrrected spread calculation (replaced /(m-1) by /m).
   -- Changed sprintf() to snprintf() throughout the code.
v. 0.98
   PS 03062015
   -- Fixed a (minor) inconsistency that led to assertion failure in some
      single observation experiments.
v. 0.97.3
   PS 11052015
   -- Corrected a defect in utils.c: replaced "sort_r()" by "qsort_r()" to
      compile correctly for systems with no qsort_r().
v. 0.97.2
   PS 08052015
   -- Added a new procedure utils.c::int getnumlevels(char fname[], char
      varname[]) and use it in H_surf_standard() to test whether the model file
      has been stripped to contain the surface layer only or not. (This is
      necessary when the top layer is not k = 0.)
   -- Added a few assertions to readfield() and writefield().
v. 0.97.1
   PS 06052015
   -- Added parameter `hastosucceed' to model_getvarid().
v. 0.97
   PS 05052015
   -- Set quit function for gridutils to enkf_quit. This change requires
      upgrade to the latest version of libgu (v. 0.54).
v. 0.96.3
   PS 05052015
   -- Fixed a defect in gridprm.c that sometimes caused exiting with error
      "VTYPE specified twice".
v. 0.96.2
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v. 0.96.1
   PS 19022015
   -- Fixed name of the "nk" dimension in pointlog files, get_nkname().
v. 0.96
   PS 17022015
   -- Fixed the call to grid_create() in model.c to pass correctly the grid type
      to the grid structure (was defaulted to GRIDVTYPE_Z). (Thanks to Paul
      Sandery for the bug report.)
v. 0.95
   PS 12022015
   -- Modified code to be able to proceed with nobs = 0; introduced a new option
      for enkf_calc "--ignore-no-obs".
v. 0.94
   PS 05022015
   -- Added code for qsort_r() activated by compiler flag -DNO_QSORT_R. (For
      systems with old glibc; based on public code sort_r.h by Isaac Turner.)
v. 0.93
   Paul Sandery 30012015
   -- Added a reader for AMSR-2.
v. 0.92.3
   PS 30012015
   -- Corrected das_updatebg() to work in the case STRIDE = 1 (thanks to Paul
      Sandery for the bug report).
v. 0.92.2
   PS 16012015
   -- Modified H_surf_standard() and H_surf_biased() to read the actual level
      of the surface variable.
v. 0.92.1
   PS 16012015
   -- Made DEPTHVARNAME optional for a grid; an error is generated in
      model_getdepth() if it is not set for the grid the variable is defined on.
   -- Made the inflation limited by half of the magnitude of the spread
      reduction.
v. 0.92
   PS 06012015
   -- Added a strict check on keywords in obstypes parameter file. Corrected
      obstypes parameter file in example 1 (replaced MIN and MAX by MINVALUE and
      MAXVALUE). Removed redundant explicit call to das_setobstypes() in
      enkf_calc.c made in the case of singleob.
   -- Corrected handling of obs error from file in obs_add().
   -- Made a few changes towards achieving consistency in handling grid
      periodicity. Affected interpolate2d(), interpolate3d(), grid_xy2fij().
   -- Do not calculate transforms for a grid in das_calctransforms() if there
      are no model variable associated with it.
   -- Corrected das_updatefields() to work in the case STRIDE = 1.
v. 0.91
   PS 12122014
   -- Structural changes: no more `models' directory. Instead, grid
      specifications now require VTYPE (currently can be either "z" or "sigma").
v. 0.90
   PS 17122014
   -- Corrected defect in verticall mapping -- thanks to Russ Fiedler for the
      bug report.
   -- Moved `gridprm' stuff to gridprm.[ch].
v. 0.89
   PS 10122014
   -- Added sigma model to enable assimilating with ROMS. Quite substantial
      secondary changes overall.
v. 0.88
   PS 20141120
   -- SUBSTANTIAL structural changes. It is now possible to have multiple grids
      within a model. Each variable is associated with one of the grids. The
      ensemble transforms are calculated separately for each grid. Analysed
      ensembles in pointlogs are produced with the transforms on the grid
      defined first in the grid parameter file, for now.
   -- A correction for the CARS reader: an obs is considered invalid if its
      depth is < 0.
v. 0.87
   PS 20141114
   -- Replaced SRF limited inflation by inflation limited by directly calculated
      spread reduction for each element of the state vector. This is a default
      inflation mode; add PLAIN to the inflation specification in the parameter
      file to use uniform inflation.
v. 0.86
   PS 20141110
   -- The variable-specific inflation set in the model parameter file now simply
      overrides (not multiplies with) the common inflation set in the main
      parameter file.
v. 0.85
   PS 20141103
   -- Added RADS reader "biased" for MDT bias correction with the EnKF.
   -- Modified format of H_fn: added varname2 to specify for the bias variable
      when necessary.
   -- Corrected a minor interpolation bug introduced in previous version in
      das_updatefields().
   -- Corrected interpolation bug in fi2x().
v. 0.84
   PS 20141024
   -- in das_updatefields() limited inflation by 1 + SRF.
v. 0.83
   PS 20141013
   -- Added a new parameter "--no-superobing" to enkf_prep.
v. 0.82
   PS 20141010
   -- Fixed a defect in update_HE() that might cause accessing observation
      array element outside the array.
v. 0.81
   PS 20141008
   -- Modified das_calcbatchstats() to run only on master.
v. 0.80

      could be used.
v. 0.79
   PS 20140919 (minor changes)
   -- Made it possible to compile without `gridutils' by defining flag
      -DNO_GRIDUTILS
v. 0.78
   PS 20140919 (minor changes)
   -- Set batch ID for NAVO and Windsat SST obs to 0 (was -1). This makes it
      possible to identify "bad batches" of these obs on "per file" basis.
v. 0.77
   PS 20140909 (moderate structural changes)
   -- Introduced `struct variable'.
   -- Changed the way the custom model initialisation is done: now it is called
      right after reading the model type; this allows to read other bits in the
      model parameter file in a custom way.
   -- Removed now redundant `struct zmodelprm' in zmodel.c. Added
      zmodel_adddata().
   -- Now read WM__INST_TYPE in MMT reader as the instrument type.
   -- Removed redudant variable `vv' in das_updatefields().
   -- Modified definition of das_updatefields() to make it more general and
      more consistent with other update procedures.
v. 0.76
   PS 20140901
   -- Renamed stage 3 from "post" to "update".
v. 0.75
   PS 20140828
   -- Introduced field `alloctype' in `modeldata' to handle de-allocation.
   -- Made the parameter `nk' in
      model_getdims(model* m, int* ni, int* nj, int* nk) optional (can be NULL
      if not needed).
v. 0.74
   PS 28082014
   -- Moved specification of variables from main parameter file to model
      parameter file.
   -- Modified entry for model data: it now should start with "DATA".
v. 0.73
   PS 27082014
   -- Reduced number of tiles for point logs by joining tiles for the same
      field for all point logs into one.
v. 0.72
   PS 26082014
   -- Made writing state variables to point log files two-stage, similar
      to other updates: first to tiles, one cpu per tile, and then the final
      "assembly". Added plog_writestatevars_toassemble() and
      plog_assemblestatevars(); plog_writestatevars() became
      plog_writestatevars_direct().
v. 0.71
   PS 20082014
   -- Made structural changes: put observation type related stuff into
      obstypes.[ch]. Introduced new "observation types" parameter file.
      Eliminated `struct obstypedesc' and global variable `obstypedesc
      otdescs[]'. Consolidated all obs type related stuff in
      observations.obstypes field. Moved all obs types related stuff from
      enkfprm_read() to obstypes_read().
   -- Added descriptions of each parameter file used; modified usage to reflect
      this.
   -- Modified obs_add() to report the number of good obs read from each data
      file (along with the total number of obs). Removed this from CARS and
      MMT readers (no longer needed).
   -- In example 1 added a new target "singleob".
v. 0.70
   PS 18082014
   -- Fixed a silly defect in das_writefields_toassemble() (an unecessary cycle
      over ensemble).
v. 0.69
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced obs_checkdatasize() and put it into readers.
v. 0.68
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced option to specify domains for each type of observations by
      entries "OBSDOMAIN <obs type> <x1> <x2> <y1> <y2> [<z1> <z2>]" in the
