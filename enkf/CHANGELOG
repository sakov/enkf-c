v1.113.8
   PS 21042020
   -- A correction to modification v1.108.6

   PS 15042020
   -- Fixed defect in reader_xy_scattered() in setting ADDVAR and SUBVAR.
v1.113.6
   PS 14042020
   -- Fixed defect in reader_xy_scattered() in setting ADDVAR.
   -- In ncu_readvardouble() and ncu_readvarfloat() eliminated processing data
      according to the default fill value if nofill = 1.
   -- A few semi-cosmetic changes in das_writevcorrs().
v1.113.5
   PS 14042020
   -- Added two options to UPDATE: "--no-update" and
      "--calculate-vertical-correlatons-only".
v1.113.4
   PS 09042020
   -- Clobber (do not try to open) spread tiles left from the previous cycle.
v1.113.3
   PS 08042020
   -- Introduced compile flag -DDEFLATE_ALL for CALC and UPDATE. By default
      the NetCDF deflation defined in the main parameter file applies only
      to observations.nc and analysis.
   -- In das_writefields_toassemble() -- if a tile does not open then clobber
      it.
v1.113.2
   PS 07042020
   -- Fixed a couple of recently introduced bugs, the most severe one in
      update_Hx() has screwed up innovation stats in EnOI.
v1.113.1
   PS 07042020
   -- In obs_read() when -DUSE_SHMEM - removed redundant setting of obs->data
      by slave processes.
v1.113.0
   PS 07042020
   -- In CALC added option of communicating ensemble transforms via file system
      -DX5_VIAFILE. It seems to work well with 0.1-degree OM2, when the normal
      (default) communication via MPI somehow gets clogged.
v1.112.5
   PS 07042020
   -- In obs_read() corrected missed initialisation of obs->data in the case
      -DUSE_DHMEM.
v1.112.4
   PS 07042020
   -- A few minor changes in grid.c.
   -- Added ncw_inq_var_fill().

v1.112.3
   PS 06042020
   -- A few fixes and tweaks in grid.c for sigma grids defined with CVARNAME
      only.
v1.112.2
   PS 03042020
   -- Added a barrier in das_calcinnandspread() that seems to eliminate
      "striping" occurring in some tests.
   -- Removed an unnecessary initialisation in das_calctransforms().
v1.112.1
   PS 02042020
   -- Minor changes in pointlog intialisation.
v1.112.0
   PS 02042020
   -- Added an H-function "vertsum". It can be used e.g. for estimating sea
      ice sheet properties from a layered sea ice model.
v1.111.11
   PS 01042020
   -- CALC now uses shared memory for the observation array obs->data.
   -- A few cosmetic changes concerned the memory usage printing.
v1.111.10
   PS 01042020
   -- Removed dependency of enkf_update on kdtree.c.
v1.111.9
   PS 01042020
   -- Replaced the name of the preprocessor conditional from "HE_VIASHMEM" to
      "USE_SHMEM".
v1.111.8
   PS 01042020
   -- Tidied up output after "--version".
v1.111.7
   PS 31032020
   -- Semi-cosmetic: corrected deallocation of a constructed MPI type.
v1.111.6
   PS 27032020
   -- In kd_setstorage() removed initialising top node on slave nodes.
   -- Destroying kd-trees of curvilinear grids in CALC on an early stage.
   -- In all shared memory allocations now using process with sm_rank = 0 as
      master.
   -- Modified kd_setstorage() to interpret the case `storage' = NULL as a flag
      to change the storage size only.
   -- Moved obs_createkdtrees() from das_calctransforms() to enkf_calc.c:main().
   -- A number of cosmetic changes.
v1.111.5
   PS 25032020
   -- Further changes to kdtree.[ch] for relocatability of the trees, including
      fixing a number of defects from v1.111.4.
   -- Modified gxy_curv_create() to avoid creating temporal trees.
   -- Changed grid attribute names in pointlog files from "NAME" to "name" and
      from "DOMAIN" to "domain", as "NAME" somehow started to cause NetCDF
      crashes with "String match to name in use".
v1.111.4
   PS 20032020
   -- Modified kd-tree.c to make it possible copy information from one tree to
      another.
   -- Modified obs_createkdtrees() to avoid creating temporal trees.
v1.111.3
   PS 20032020
   -- Modified kdtree.c to allocate kdtree.nodes and kdtree.coords as a single
      block of memory rather than two separate blocks.
v1.111.2
   PS 19032020
   -- Removed redundant kd_printinfo() in gxy_curv_create().
v1.111.1
   PS 19032020
   -- A minor change in obs_createkdtrees() to pre-allocate the known number of
      nodes in a tree.
v1.111.0
   PS 19032020
   -- Created H_subsurf_lowmem() as an alternative to H_subsurf_standard(). The
      new function reads variable by two layers at a time rather than the whole
      3D field. This is aimed at reducing memory when dealing with very large
      models, but somehow I can not see the reduction in memory usage so far
      :(.
v1.110.4
   PS 17032020
   -- Split das->S and das->St arrays, including allocating shared memory from
      different processes.
v1.110.3
   PS 17032020
   -- In CALC added option "--print-memory-usage".
   -- Added global variables `sm_comm_size' and `sm_comm_rank_master' to manage
      process used for shared memory allocation (rather than using process with
      sm_comm_rank = 0 only).
v1.110.2
   PS 13032020
   -- Replaced # of CPUs used for updating HE from "#define HE_NPROCMAX 20" to
      the number of cores used on the first node.

v1.108.11
   PS 06032020
   -- Moved MPI communicators etc. for handling shared memory stuff from
      `struct dasystem' to global.c; moved code for setting MPI communicators
      etc. from das_create() to enkf_init().
v1.108.10
   PS 04032020
   -- Still more cosmetic changes related to v1.108.2.

      CALC.

   PS 25022020
   -- A minor change in XYZ node tree handling.
v1.108.3
   PS 25022020
   -- Destroyed XYZ node trees (if there are any) after getting HE.
v1.108.2
   PS 25022020
   -- Added reporting the size of kd-trees involved.
v1.108.1
   PS 22012020
   -- Added code to obs_add() to remove standard parameters handled in obs_add()
      (these are VARSHIFT, MINDEPTH, MAXDEPTH, FOOTPRINT) from the paramaters
      passed to readers; then removed the checks for these parameters from all
      readers.
v1.108.0
   PS 21012020
   -- Added parameters VARSHIFT, MINDEPTH, MAXDEPTH, FOOTPRINT to all readers
      (I think).
   -- Removed redundant parameter ADD from reader_rads_standard() and
      reader_rads_standard2() (the MDT is subtracted via for SLA in obstypes
      parameter file).
v1.107.7
   PS 24122019
   -- Added an barrier in das_getHE(), just in case.
   -- Changed a number of "int"s to "size_t"s in ncutils.c to handle variables
      of larger size.
v1.107.6
   PS 19122019
   -- Fixed a defect in get_insttag().
v1.107.5
   PS 18122019
   -- Check that parameters are only entered once in each section of the
      observation data parameter file.
v1.107.4
   PS 16122019
   -- Eliminated compile flag -DHE_VIAFILE.
v1.107.3
   PS 10122019
   -- A few cosmetic changes.
v1.107.2
   PS 06122019
   -- Added mask to arguments of kd_insertnodes(). Made a few internal changes
      in kdtree.c, mainly related to moving `id_orig' (the sequential number of
      the node) to `data'. It is still set to the sequential number of the node
      in kd_insertnodes() if parameter "data" is NULL.
v1.107.1
   PS 05122019
   -- Cleaned up a mess with two kd-trees, one in struct grid (used for
      estimating observations with finite footprint), and another in struct
      gxy_curv (used for fij <-> xy mappings).
v1.107.0
   PS 04122019
   -- A few modifications to make it possible to define 1D offsets for 3D
      observation types, treated as (negative) layer-wise model field offsets.
v1.106.4
   PS 02122019
   A minor modification in kdtree.c to save a memory allocation per search.
v1.106.3
   PS 02122019
   -- Replaced the point-in-quadrilateral test in gxy_curv.c by the one based on
      Algorithm 1 from Hao et al. (2018).
v1.106.2
   PS 29112019
   -- A minor modification in initialising curvilinear grids in grid_create()
      that treats filled/missing values properly.
v1.106.1
   PS 28112019
   -- A minor correction in inquadri(): correcting the cycle to be over 4 edges,
      not 5. I actually do not get why, but somehow the previous (obviously
      wrong) version seemed to work equally well in tests.
v1.106.0
   PS 27112019
   -- Moved grid mapping stuff from libgu to gxy_curv.[ch] and thus eliminated
      dependence on libgu.
   -- Stripped the option parsing grid into a binary tree; the only option now
      is parsing into kd-tree.
v1.105.2
   PS 22112019
   -- A few semi-cosmetic changes in update.c and diags.c to eliminate compiler
      warnings from gcc v8.2.1.
v1.105.1
   PS 21102019
   -- In reader_cmems_standard() and reader_mmt_standard() modified reporting on
      the number of profiles and on the number of unique profile locations so
      that only profiles containing at least one good observation (this requires
      the observation to be in the model grid domain) are considered.
      considered.
v1.105.0
   PS 21102019
   -- Added vertical coordinate type "none" to grid parameter file for handling
      purely 2D grids. (Before that they had to be treated as 1-layer 3D grids.)
v1.104.13
   PS 18102019
   -- A correction to v1.104.12.
v1.104.12
   PS 18102019
   -- Fixed inconsistency between description of QC flags specification in
      the file headers of generic readers and get_qcflags(). Also put in checks
      that (i) an entry of the QC flag name is always followed by QCFLAGVALS
      and (ii) an entry of QCFLAGVALS is always preceeded by QCGLAGVARNAME.
v1.104.11
   PS 16102019
   -- Added a few convenience targets in Makefile.
v1.104.10
   PS 11102019
   -- Changed das_printobsstats() and das_printfobsstats() to skip printing
      stats for asynchronous time intervals if there is only one such interval
      in the cycle.
v1.104.9
   PS 08102019
   -- Fixed yet another redundancy in grid.c related to having -DNO_GRIDUTILS
      in UPDATE.
v1.104.8

   -- Modified gridprm_create() to ignore "MAPTYPE" when compiled with
      -DNO_GRIDUTILS.
v1.104.7
   PS 07102019
   -- Removed reader_pathfinder_standard() and the associated stuff.
v1.104.6
   PS 07102019
   -- Initialised char instrument[] in generic readers to "".
   -- Deallocated "time" in reader_cmems_standard().
   -- Deallocated "gz" in gz_hybrid_destroy().
v1.104.5
   PS 01102019
   -- Changed default indentification of time variable in generic readers. Now
      the default variable can be "time" (case insensitive) only. In case of
      offset/difference time variables they need to be specified explicitly via
      entry TIMENAMES (in any order).
v1.104.4
   PS 01102019
   -- Fixed a defect at reading SOBSTRIDE in obstypes_read(). (Thanks to Paul
      Sandery for the report.)
v1.104.3
   PS 01102019
   -- In generic readers fixed the check on matching the specified quality
      flags.
   -- In enkf_prep::main() added re-calculating the obs stats if some obs
      on land are removed.

      variable to be subtracted from observations.
v1.104.1
   PS 26092019
   -- A few insignificant changes to eliminate warnings from gcc v9.1.0.
v1.104.0
   PS 25092019
   -- Added get_time() to prep_utils.c; modified reader_xyz_gridded(),
      reader_xyz_scattered(), reader_xy_gridded(), reader_z(), and
      reader_xyh_gridded() accordingly.
   -- Corrected NINSTNAMES from 3 to 5.

      other generic readers.
v1.103.3
   PS 25092019
   -- Fixed two defects in obsprm.c: a potentially major one in obsprm_read(),
      and an insignificant one in obsprm_destroy().

   PS 23092019
   -- Eliminated dynamic allocation of sloc and plobs at each cycle in
      das_calctransforms() with -DMINIMISE_ALLOC.
v1.103.1
   PS 20092019
   -- A minor technical change in prepare_transforms().
v1.103.0
   PS 19092019
   -- Reshuffled transform calculations (S,G,M,w,T,X5...) for simplicity.
   -- Introduced cast2d() for changing matrix size without reallocation.
   -- Added compile flag -DMINIMISE_ALLOC as a default for CALC. Modified a
      number of procedures in calcs.c to use pre-allocated storage when
      compiled with -DMINIMISE_ALLOC.
v1.102.0
   PS 12092019
   -- Changed (actually, corrected) the "moderation of spread reduction" (sec.
      2.7.4 of the User Guide) for the ETKF, making it consistent with the
      "relaxation to prior" technique by Zhang et al. 2004.
   -- Reshuffled interfaces of a number of function in calcs.[ch].
   -- Eliminated compile flags -DCHECK_G and -DCHECK_X5 (no need).
v1.101.3
   PS 06092019
   -- Added <stdarg.h> to ncutils.c.
v1.101.2

   PS 06092019
   -- Moved NetCDF procedures from utils.[ch] to ncutils.[ch].
v1.101.0
   PS 06092019
   -- Added an option to check the time of model dumps used in
      asynchronous/FGAT DA versus the time of the corresponding observation
      time windows. This check is activated by adding the time variable name at
      the end of the entry "ASYNCHRONOUS" in the obstypes parameter file. E.g.
      "ASYNCHRONOUS 1" could become "ASYNCHRONOUS 1 C Time", and
      "ASYNCHRONOUS 0.25 E" could become "ASYNCHRONOUS 0.25 E Time".
v1.100.5
   PS 150720199

      correlations from update/update.c to update/diag.c.
v1.100.4

   -- Modified reader_mmt_standard() to read time from the file rather than set
      it from the file name.
   -- Eliminated tolerances on the observation window (DT_EPS) in obs_add().
v1.100.3
   PS 04072019
   -- Added a couple of routine checks in read_ncvardouble() and
      read_ncvarfloat().
v1.100.2
   PS 02072019
   -- Modified generic readers to read instrument tag from an appropiate global
      or variable attribute (attribute name "instrument", "Instrument",
      "INSTRUMENT", "platform", "Platform", "PLATFORM") when it exists.
v1.100.1
   PS 25062019
   -- Added ncw_att_exists2(); modified NetCDF i/o procedures in prep_utils.c
      and utils.c to honor _FillValue, valid_min, valid_max, and valid_range
      only if these attributes are of the same type as their host variable.
v1.100.0

      valid_range attributes.
v1.99.5
   PS 17062019
   -- Modified readfield() and read3dfield() to provide more robust treatment
      (hopefully) of _FillValue, missing_value, valid_min, valid_max, and
      valid_range attributes.
v1.99.4

   -- Modified reader_xy_scattered() and reader_xyz_scattered() to accommodate
      read_ncvardouble() (with the gridded readers on the way).
v1.98.25
   PS 12062019
   -- Untangled attrubutes scale_factor and add_offset in reader_xy_scattered()

v1.98.23
   PS 2052019

      This makes it possible to interpolate without parsing the grid in UPDATE
      (possible after v1.98.18).
   -- Corrected gxy_curv_destroy() for the case nodes->gn = NULL (necessary
      after v1.98.18).

   -- Corrected das_setnmem() to use specified ensemble size if it is smaller
      than than the available one.
v1.98.14
   PS 03052019
   -- Moved putting attribute "output" in pointlog files from plog_create()
      to plog_definestatevars().
v1.98.13
   PS 03052019
   -- In pointlog files added global attribute "output" (which has value of
      either "analysis" or "increment") and forecast variables attribute
      "gridid".
v1.98.12
   PS 02052019
   -- Corrected plog_writetransform() to handle case of zero local obs.
v1.98.11
   PS 02052019
   -- Corrected plog_assemblestatevars().
   -- Corrected das_update() to write correct forecasts and increments in
      pointlogs for EnOI.
v1.98.10
   PS 01052019
   -- Corrected the writing of EnOI ensemble in plog_writestatevars_direct() and
      plog_writestatevars_toassemble().
v1.98.9
   PS 01052019
   -- Fixed a defect in plog_writestatevars_toassemble().
v1.98.8
   PS 01052019

   PS 01052019
   -- In pointlog files added instrument ids.
v1.98.6
   PS 01052019
   -- In pointlog files for each observation type added attribute
      "GRIDID_<type>".
v1.98.5

   -- In pointlog files added global parameter "ngrids".
v1.98.4
   PS 30042019
   -- A minor correction in pointlog initialisation in das_create().
v1.98.3
   PS 30042019
   -- In pointlog files added global parameters MODE and SCHEME.
   -- In pointlog files changed grid parameter "depth" to "model_depth".

v1.98.1
   PS 29042019
   -- A minor correction in plogs_add().
v1.98.0
   PS 29042019
   -- Changed point logs: now a pointlog entry specifies a geographic location
      instead of a grid node. In CALC, the ensemble transforms on each grid are
      calculated for this location. In UPDATE, the forecast and analysis state
      variables on each grid are interpolated to this location.
v1.97.2
   PS 05042019
   --Fixed a kdtree related compilation defect in grid.c and grid.h manifested on
     Intel compilers. Thanks to Prasanth Divarkan for the report.
v1.97.1
   PS 04042019
   -- Fixed a compilation defect in grid.c manifested in the case -DNO_GIDUTILS.
      Thanks to Prasanth Divarkan for the report.
v1.97.0
   PS 03042019
   -- Added an optional trtentry STATSONLY to obstypes parameter file.
v1.96.3
   PS 28032019
   -- Eliminated seeding drand48 from a fixed seed in shuffle(), both in
      utils.c and kdtree.c, to eliminate posibility of the generator becoming
      (re-)synchronised on different processes.
v1.96.2
   PS 28032019
   -- Tidied up log messages. Made sure that if enkf_verbose = 0 then no log
      appears.
v1.96.1
   PS 28032019
   -- Some minor shuffling of barriers in das_update(), probably with no
      noticable implications.
v1.96.0
   PS 27032019
   -- Moved SOBSTRIDE from grid parameter file to obstypes parameter file.
      Therefore, one can either specify a common stride for superobing in the
      main paramater file, or (override it with) observation type specific
      strides.
v1.95.5
   PS 27032019
   -- Changed field names obstype.windowmin -> obstype.obswindow_min,
      obstype.windowmax -> obstype.obswindow_max, obstype.day_min ->
      obstype.time_min, obstype.day_max -> obstype.time_max,
      enkfprm.windowmin -> enkfprm.obswindow_min, enkfprm.windowmax ->
      enkfprm.obswindow_max, grid.tree -> grid.nodetree.
v1.95.4
   PS 27032019

v1.95.1
   PS 26032019
   -- A minor change in obsprm_read().
v1.95.0
   PS 26032019
   -- Introduced a new parameter FOOTPRINT in observation parameter file, which
      specifies the observation footprint radius in km. Added field "footprint"
      to "struct observation". Modified 2D readers in model2obs.c to handle
      observations with non-zero footprint. Added ability to handle parameter
      FOOTPRINT to reader_amsr2_standard(), reader_xy_gridded(),
      reader_xy_scattered(), reader_xyz_gridded(), reader_xyz_scattered().
v1.94.4
   PS 25032019
   -- Changed field name in struct observation from "day" to "time". A few other
      cosmetic changes.
v1.94.3
   PS 25032019
   -- Changes some names in structures as well as output file formats. "std"
      generally became "estd" for "error std"; "date" in situation where it
      represents time in days became "day", "DA_JULDAY" became "DA_DAY". This is
      supposed to be a cosmetic change aimed at improving code consistency and
      readability.
v1.94.2
   PS 22032019
   -- An empty entry "ZSTATINTS =" in the grid parameter file now specifies
      no vertical statistical intervals (as opposed to default intervals in the
      case of no entry).
v1.94.1
   PS 22032019
   -- A minor correction in das_calctransforms() that fixes numerics of
      calculating partial SRF ("psrf") when pdfs is close to 0.
v1.94.0
   PS 21032019
   -- Added entry ERROR_STD_MIN to obstypes parameter file to specify minimal
      allowed error standard deviation for an observation type.
   -- Made HFUNCTION entry optional, with the default value "standard".
v1.93.4
   PS 15032019
   -- Moved checks for observations being in allowed spatial domains for their
      type (XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX, ZMIN, ZMAX) from readers to obs_add().
v1.93.3
   PS 14032019
   -- In obs_add() implemented filtering by ot->zmin and ot->zmax.
   -- In das_printfobsstats() and das_printobsstats() changed filtering by
      depth intervals: z > z1 && z <= z2 became z >= z1 && z < z2.
v1.93.2
   PS 12032019
   - Another follow-on fix to v1.93.0.
v1.93.1
   PS 12032019
   - A follow-on fix to v1.93.0.
v1.93.0
   PS 12032019
   -- Added entry ALIAS to obstypes parameter file that if specified is to be
      used instead of the variable name. The purpose is to handle situations
      when the surface field and 3D field of the same variable have different
      asynchronous settings.
v1.92.5
   PS 12032019
   -- Modified reader_cmems_standard() to skip and continue on an invalid QC
      flag value.
v1.92.4
   PS 08032019
   -- Modified das_updatefields() for the case "--output-increment" to set
      increment to 0 not only if the field element is too large, but also if
      it is is NaN.
v1.92.3
   PS 06032019
   -- Modified readfield() to ignore k if there is only one vertical field in
      the file.
v1.92.2
   PS 04032019
   -- Fixed obs_add() to handle PARAMETER MAXDEPTH in relevant readers. Thanks
      to Roger Scott for the bug report.
v1.92.1
   PS 04032019
   -- Two technical fixes in das_updatefields() and writerow() to handle case
      with top layer id != 0.
v1.92.0
   PS 01032019
   -- Added parameter MAXDEPTH to reader_xy_gridded(), reader_xy_scattered(),
      reader_xyz_gridded(), reader_xyz_scattered(), reader_xyh_gridded().
   -- Tidied up code for MINDEPTH in reader_rads_standard(),
      reader_rads_standard2(), reader_viirs().
v1.91.13
   PS 01022019
   -- Removed re-seeding from addnoise(); modified enkf_init() to ensure that
      the random number generator is initialised randomly for each process.
v1.91.12
   PS 31012019
   -- Re-seeded rand48() with the variable ID in addnoise() to make sure that
      different random sequences are used for different variables.
   -- Changed name model_getvardims() to model_getvargriddims().
v1.91.11
   PS 29012019

      mean of the added perturbations.
v1.91.10
   PS 29012019
   -- Added global parameters "version" and "alpha" to pointlogs.
v1.91.9

   -- Fixed enkf_printcompileflags() for the flag NCW_SKIPSINGLE.
v1.91.8
   PS 24012019
   -- Fixed X5 in pointlog files for SCHEME = ETKF.
v1.91.7
   PS 22012019
   -- A cosmetic correction in printing domains in obstype_print().
v1.91.6
   PS 21012019
   -- A minor correction in usage message.
v1.91.5
   PS 06122018
   -- Added a few checks in reader_xy_scattered() and reader_xyz_scattered().
v1.91.4
   PS 05122018
   -- Skip writing a variable to a pointlog if they are on different grids.
v1.91.3
   PS 28112018

   -- Added option "--use-existing-transforms" to CALC.
v1.90.4
   PS 23112018
   -- A few changes in kdtree.c. The main one concerns the search of nodes
      within specified distance from a location, where individual allocations
      where replaced by allocations of blocks of 1024 nodes.
v1.90.3
   PS 21112018
   -- A few minor changes in obs_read() and obs_write().
v1.90.2
   PS 20112018
   -- Introduced compile flag MINIMISE_ALLOC in CALC, which aims at eliminating
      the largest sources of dynamic memory allocation during calculating
      transforms, which can cause OOM problems on very large system. (Nothing
      is supposed to change for default setting.)
v1.90.1
   PS 14112018
   -- Updated to ncw v2.23.2: it now removes skipping singleton dimensions by
      default in ncw_copy_vardef(); one needs to define NCW_SKIPSINGLE to
      activate it.
v1.90.0
   PS 13112018
   -- Added PREP parameter "--no-thinning".
v1.89.17

      does not exist.
v1.89.15
   PS 09112018
   -- Added MPI_Type_commit()/MPI_Type_free() after MPI_Type_contiguous().
      Seems to be necessary, but surprisingly OpenMPI worked without it, while

v1.89.11
   PS 01112018
   -- Modified default behaviour in enkf_calc.c:main() to exit with error if
      there are no observations; use "--ignore-no-obs" to proceed cleanly.
v1.89.10
   PS 01112018
   -- Modified reading depth in reader_cmems_standard(). Now for each datum
      the first valid depth value out of four candidate variables is used.
v1.89.9
   PS 31102018
   -- A number of minor changes in HE stuff, supposed to be cosmetic.
v1.89.8
   PS 29102018
   -- A number of minor, mostly cosmetic, changes.
v1.89.7

      dimensions.
v1.89.5
   PS 25102018
   -- Fixed defect introduced in v1.89.3 in writefield() and writerow() (handle
      # records = 0).
v1.89.4
   PS 24102018
   -- Fixed an internal overflow in multiplication at calculating the size of
      the HE array in das_getHE(). This defect manifested in large systems only.
v1.89.3
   PS 23102018
   -- Replaced utils.c:hasunlimdim() by ncw.c:ncw_var_hasunlimdim().
v1.89.2
   PS 18102018
   -- Added ADDBIAS parameter to reader_amsr2_standard() (initially implemented
      by Xinmei Huang).
v1.89.1
   PS 18102018
   -- A bit of tidying up.
v1.89.0
   PS 17102018
   -- Introduced entries "DOMAIN" in the grid parameter file and "DOMAINS" in
      the obstypes parameter file. They provide a mechanism for disconnecting
      observations of a given type from updating variables on certain grids.
      (See sec. 2.7.8 "Domains" of the User Guide.)
v1.88.4
   PS 15102018
   -- Corrected island() to handle the case when Z axis is directed towards the
      surface.
v1.88.3
   PS 26092018

      reader_xyz_scattered() to allow multiple instances of QC flags (e.g.
      for the observed variable and coordinates). In prep_utils.c created
      get_lonname()m get_latname(), get_zname(), get_timename(), get_qcflags()
      for common treatment in readers.
v1.87.1
   PS 17092018

      than whether the column is on land or not.
v1.86.1
   PS 12092018
   -- Fixed a defect in obs_superob() that (extremely rarely) manifested as
      "Assertion `o->status == 0' failed".

      with --describe-superob.
v1.85.10

   -- In reader_cmems_standard() - changed time variable from JULD_LOCATION
      to JULD.
v1.85.8

      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v1.84.5
   PS 15082018
   -- Modified st_add() to handle the recent replacement st_add_ifabsent() by
      st_add() + check (which is more robust, I guess) in obs_read(): it now
      simply returns (not quits) if the existing entry has the same ID as the
      requested ID.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v1.84.4
   PS 15082018

v1.83.1
   PS 05072018
   -- Added QCFLAGNAME and QCFLAGVALS to reader_xyz_scattered() (for now).
   -- Added prmfname to struct obsmeta for better error messaging in readers.
v1.83.0
   PS 29062018
   -- Modified superob grid so that the centres of superob cells now coincide
      with the nodes of the grid for the corresponding model variable.
      This addresses the "second problem" reported by Hugo Oliveira in
      https://github.com/sakov/enkf-c/issues/5.
v1.82.4
   Hugo Oliveira 27062018
   -- Fixed bugs for sigma introduced in v1.81.0.
v1.82.3
   PS 26062018
   -- A fix of a defect in ncw_copy_vardef() that often prevented creating
      unlimited dimension.
   -- A few fixes in update.c that make it possible to calculate forecast
      spread without running CALC (note that one needs to comment out point
      log specs in the main parameter file for it).
v1.82.2
   PS 25062018
   -- A minor fix in ncw_copy_vardef() to deal with unlimited dimensions.
   -- A minor (supposedly cosmetic) rewrite in traceprod().
v1.82.1
   PS 22062018
   Modified ncw_copy_vardef() to handle the case when some of the dimensions
   of the variable being copied already exist in the destination file and have
   different length. This manifested in errors during assembly of spread.nc
   (and, I guess, inflation.nc).
v1.82.0
   PS 19062012
   Harmonised specifying LOCRAD in the main parameter file with that in the
   obstypes parameter file. Replaced WEIGHT by LOCWEIGHT.
v1.81.2
   PS 18062018
   A bit of clean-up; in particular removed asynchronous entries from struct
   enkfprm, as they belong now to struct obstype.
v1.81.1
   PS 18062018
   Cosmetic changes; in particular renamed obsmeta.[ch] to obsprm.[ch].
v1.81.0
   PS 15062018
   Modified code for sigma coordinate to permit stretching as described in
   https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Vertical_S-coordinate, Vstretching = 5
   (Vstretching = 2..4 did not require that, and Vstretching = 1 corresponds to
   the "old" stretching function (1) that is not handled in EnKF-C).
v1.80.9
   PS 14062018
   Corrected calculation of zt[] in gz_sigma_z2fk() and in grid_fk2z() for
   "g->vtype == GRIDVTYPE_SIGMA" in the case when hc != 0.
   Thanks to Frank Colberg for the bug report and correction.
v1.80.8
   PS 12062018
   Cosmetically modified stringtable.[ch].
v1.80.7
   PS 12062018
   A few minor changes to make sure that the system runs fine when nobs = 0 (and
   CALC is run with --ignore-no-obs).
v1.80.6
   PS 08062018
   A correction in reader_xy_gridded().
v1.80.4
   PS 07062018
   Re-wrote das_writecorrs() for better parallelisation.
v1.80.3
   PS 07062018
   -- Multiple technical changes. Among substantial ones: it seems that the
      lon/lat coordinate order in reader_xy_gridded() and reader_xyz_gridded()
      has been swapped (i.e. lat was assumed to be the innermost one).
v1.80.2
   PS 07062018
   -- Some internal reshuffling, mainly concerning reading/writing of the
      fields, and also of das_writecorrs(), which seems too slow.
v1.80.1
   PS 06062018
   -- Added UPDATE option "--calculate-vertical-correlations".
v1.80.0
   PS 06062018
   -- Added UPDATE option "--calculate-forecast-spread". This skips calculating
      analysis spread.
v1.79.2
   PS 04062018
   -- Trying to work through occasional problems arising when trying to put
      spreads of each variable (normally stored in different files) into common
      "spread.nc". This fix targets a particular MOM feature that creates output
      files with dimension names xaxis_1, yaxis_1, zaxis_1 regardless of those
      of the grids the variables are defined on... Therefore: in
      ncw_copy_vardef() -- do not create outer limited dimensions of size 1.
v1.79.1
   PS 01062018
   -- A minor change in model_create() to permit case sensitive grid names.
v1.79.0
   PS 30052018
   -- In reader_mmt.c: only use data with TEMP_BLUELINK_QC (for T) or
      PSAL_BLUELINK_QC (for S) = 0.
v1.78.0
   PS 21052018
   -- Shifted transform used for updating an observation at (fi, fj) from
      ((int) fi, (int) fj) to ((int) (fi + 0.5), (int) (fj + 0.5)). This is
      supposed to be more consistent, but inpractice makes a very little
      difference.
v1.77.1
   PS 09052018
   -- Added an error message in das_setnmem() to print the name of the missing
      model file when nmem = 0.
v1.77.0
   PS 03052018
   -- Added capability to limit the number of observations of each type used
      in local analyses via entries NLOBSMAX in the main and obstypes parameter
      files.
v1.76.5
   PS 01052018
   -- Removed what supposed to be a check on positive layer thicknesses in
      gz_hybrid_create(), as one needs to run it on the layer coordinates rather
      than on at/ac/bt/bc coefficients, and for that one needs to know the
      (approximate) surface pressure that seems unavailble at that point.
v1.76.4
   PS 01052018
   -- Corrected assertions at the end of gz_z_create() and gz_sigma_create() to
      work for 1-layer model (replaced < by <=).
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the report.
v1.76.3
   PS 01052018
   -- Corrected error message in reader_xyh_gridded(). 
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the report.
v1.76.2
   PS 30042018
   -- Removed redundant declarations in model.h.
v1.76.1
   PS 27042018
   -- Corrected update_HE() and update_Hx() in the case -DHE_VIASHMEM. This is
      a relatively minor correction that should improve calcuation of analysis
      observation stats.
v1.76.0
   PS 27042018
   -- Moved specification of ZSTATINTS from the main parameter file to the grid
      parameter file.
      NOTE: this may require update of the existing parameter files.
v1.75.0
   PS 27042018
   -- Removed redundant struct obsdomain in enkfprm.h.
v1.74.13
   PS 24042018
   -- Corrected defect in distribute_iterations() introduced in v1.74.1
v1.74.12
   PS 23042018
   -- das_getHE(): a correction of the ensemble size in the case
      (das->mode == MODE_ENOI && enkf_fstatsonly).
v1.74.11
   PS 20042018
   -- A minor correction in update_Hx() and update_HE().
v1.74.10
   PS 20042018
   -- A few minor modifications in update_Hx() and update_HE() for faster
      cycling of parallel jobs. Increased HE_NPROCMAX from 10 to 20.
v1.74.9
   PS 20042018
   -- Do not moderate observations if observations.nc already contains moderated
      obs. Previously, the moderated obs has not been written in this case, but
      still moderated (for the second time).
v1.74.8
   PS 20042018
   -- A minor correction in update_Hx(). A few cosmetic (I think) corrections.
v1.74.7
   PS 19042018
   -- Improved gather_St() (hopefully).
v1.74.6
   PS 19042018
   -- Improved gathering of HE with -DHE_VIASHMEM. Removed a few barriers.
v1.74.5
   PS 19042018
   -- Mainly barriers to work with -DHE_VIASHMEM.
v1.74.4
   PS 18042018
   -- A minor correction in update_HE().
v1.74.3
   PS 18042018
   -- It seems that MPI_Barrier() is needed before MPI_Allgatherv()...
v1.74.2
   PS 18042018
   -- Fixed a defect in the latest version of distribute.c.
v1.74.1
   PS 18042018
   -- Limited the number of parallel processes updating HE by
      min(10, nprocesses); otherwhile I/O can become a bottleneck, I think.
v v1.74.0
   PS 17042018
   -- Introduced shared memory model for HE in CALC (need to be compiled with
      -DHE_VISHMEM). This is useful for situations when CALC becomes memory
      limited.
   -- Parallelised update_HE() when compiled with -DHE_VIASHMEM.
v1.73.1
   PS 10042018
   -- Eliminated an argument in H_fn definition in allhs.h.
v1.73.0
   PS 06042018
   -- Using a user defined MPI data type for communicating ensemble obs between
      members rather than MPI_float. This allows to overcome the MPI limit on
      the number of elements (currently 2^31 - 1) that manifests when the number
      of ensemble observations becomes very large (>~ 2.5e8).
   -- A minor modification in enkf_prep to print obs stats when not superobing.
v1.72.1
   PS 06042018
   -- A (probably, temporal) fix for a very rarely manifested defect caused by
      the mismatch between the data types used for observation fractional grid
      coordinates when stored in observations.nc (float) and when first
      calculated in data readers (double).
v1.72.0
   PS 27032018
   -- Introduced a new parameter EXCLUDEINST in reader_mmt_standard(). Should be
      used as e.g. "PARAMETER EXCLUDEINST = WMO995".
v1.71.2
   PS 27032018
   -- A possible bug fix in grid_setlonbase(). A few cosmetic changes in grid.c.
      A minor change in Makefile.
v1.71.1
   PS 26032018
   -- A minor modification for Z grids: when ZCVARNAME is specified --
      distinguish cases nkc = nk and nkc = nk + 1.
v1.71.0
   PS 26032018
   -- Implemented the "new" ROMS formulation of the vertical sigma coordinate,
      with the associated changes in gridprm.[ch] and grid.c.
v1.70.5
   PS 08032018
   -- Eliminated field "nallocated" in struct stringtable.
v1.70.4
   PS 08032018
   -- Eliminated getnumlevels(), which was redundant because of getnlevels().
v1.70.3
   PS 08032018
   -- Changed find_files() to use glob rather than shell command "ls".
v1.70.2
   PS 07032018
   -- In utils.c replaced code borrowed from Jdn_L.C for day difference
      calculation by that from Scaldate.C (see
      http://www.diyspeakers.net/snippets.org/c.snippets.org/browser.html).
v1.70.1
   PS 06032018
   -- A minor change in error messages in readfield() and read3dfield().
v1.70.0
   PS 06032018
   -- Eliminated readfield() and read3dfield(); renamed readfield2() as
      readfield() and read3dfield2() as read3dfield(); modified the rest of the
      code accordingly. This ensures that the dimensions of the fields read are
      always consistent with the assumed dimensions.
v1.69.7
   PS 15022018
   -- Tidied up output in print_obsstats().
   -- A few other cosmetic changes.
v1.69.6
   PS 31012018
   -- Reverted to DEPTHFNAME being optional for sigma grids.
   -- Corrected defect in reading VDIR in the grid parameter file.
v1.69.5
   PS 31012018
   -- Cut redundant interpolations in grid_fk2z() for hybrid grids.
v1.69.4
   PS 30012018
   -- Modified grid_fk2z() accordingly (see v1.69.3). (This includes correcting
      a bug in grid_fk2z() for hybrid grids.)
v1.69.3
   PS 25012018
   -- Modified z2fk_basic() to handle the case
      zt[i] != 0.5 * (zc[i] + zc[i + 1]).
v1.69.2
   PS 25012018
   -- Modified hybrid grids stuff in grid.c to get robust z <-> k conversions.
v1.69.1

   -- Modified fk2z() for hybrid grids. (Still may need some attention.)
v1.69.0
   PS 24012018
   -- Modified checks of a point belonging to a longitude interval in
      das_printobsstats() and das_printfobsstats.
v1.68.12
   PS 23012018
   -- Fixed a bug in reader_xyh_gridded().
   -- Tidied obs_add().
   -- Corrected enkf_prep.c:main() for the case --no-superobing.
v1.68.11
   PS 22012018
   -- Corrected placement of #endif in grid.c that resulted in a compilation
      error with -DNO_GRIDUTILS.
v1.68.10
   PS 22012018
   -- A minor fix in enkf_prep.c.
v1.68.9
   PS 20012018
   -- A minor change of the work flow in PREP.
v1.68.8
   PS 19012018
   -- Finalising this development patch.
v1.68.7-dev
   PS 19012018
   -- Added write/read of superobs in PREP before checking for land to exclude
      round-up effects.
v1.68.6-dev
   PS 19012018
   -- Allow running CALC twice (I hope), just ignoring the previous stuff.
   -- Made sob_stride grid-dependent. SOBSTRIDE = 0 means no superobing on this
      grid.
   -- Tidied and moved handling of array of grids from model.c to grid.c.
   -- Modified grid_xy2fij(), grid_z2fk(), grid_fk2z() to return meaningful
      status (previously done by model_*()).
   -- Changed format of readers -- replaced model* in the argument list by
      grid*.
   -- Added obstypes_set().
v1.68.5-dev
   PS 17012018
   -- Added deletion of superobs on land in PREP.
v1.68.4-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Added check for superobs being on land in PREP when obs->stride > 1.
v1.68.3-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Eliminated STATUS_ROUNDUP and associated code in model2obs(). Moved
      the associated check to PREP.
   -- Moved calculation of struct observation.model_depth from paticular readers
      to obs_add().
   -- Added island() as an analogue to interpolate2d() used for calculation
      of struct observation.model_depth for situations when there is no depth
      variable defined for a grid.
   -- Synced ncw.[ch] with ncw-c v2.15.
   -- Eliminated STATUS_MISSING as it is not used anymore.
v1.68.2-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Brought grid_describeprm() up to date.

      continue").
   -- Started updating the user guide.
v1.68.1-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Modified error message in reader_xyh_gridded().
v1.68.0-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Substantial changes in the vertical grid code. The entries XDIMNAME,
      YDIMNAME, ZDIMNAME have been eliminated from the grid parameter file.
      Two new optional parameters have been added:
        - VDIR, with two possible values: FROMSURF (default) and TOSURF;
        - ZCVARNAME.
   -- Added ncw_inq_vardimlen().
v1.67.7
   PS 15012018
   -- In readfield(), readfield2(), read3dfield(), read3dfield2() allowed the
      extra outer dimension to be a non-record dimension if its length is 1.
v1.67.6
   PS 15012018
   -- Fixed defect in v1.67.5.
v1.67.5

   -- Modified tunits_convert() to understand "hours".
   -- Changed data type of calcstats.nlobs_sum from int to long long int.
v1.67.3
   PS 05012018
   -- Corrected a defect in reading INSTRUMENT parameter in reader_xy*()
      procedures.
v1.67.2
   PS 04012018
   -- Elaborated observation stats: split "noutside" into "noutside_grid",
      "noutside_obsdomain" and "noutside_obswindow".
v1.67.1
   PS 03012018
   -- Changed cycling in reader_xyh_gridded() to make k the fastest index (this
      is supoposed to accelerate fk2z and z2fk conversions).
v1.67.0
   PS 03012018
   -- Replaced TODO in obs_create_fromsingleob() by a call to model_fk2z().
v1.66.5-dev
   PS 03012018

   -- Added a few lacking pieces for hybrid vertical grids.
   -- Modified update_HE() to handle observations on multiple grids.

   -- Fixed a defect in Makefile introduced in r556.
v1.66.1-dev
   PS 11122017

   PS 11122017
   -- Started implementing hybrid vertical grid.
v1.65.8

v1.65.2
   PS 24112017
   -- Introduced option "non-centred" for the asynchronous time binning
      intervals. By default the interval 0 is centred about the assimilation
      time. When specified as "non-centred" its start considdes with the
      assimilation time.
v1.65.1
   PS 14112017
   -- A minor correction in obstypes_read().
v1.65.0
   PS 10112017

      make it possible to obtain clean stats on each instrument type.
v1.64.4
   PS 09112017
   -- In model_adddata() added a check that the field dimension matches the
      the assumed (model) dimension.
v1.64.3
   PS 07112017
   -- Included observations outside strictly defined observation window into
      slot "outside" in observation statistics reported by PREP.
v1.64.2
   PS 07112017
   -- "ASYNC 0" is now considered as specifying synchronous DA (i.e. is
      equivalent to the absense of this entry).
v1.64.1
   PS 07112017
   -- Modified grid_create() to allow z-grids with no depth specified (e.g. for
      atmosphere). `numlevels' is then simply set to the number of layers
      everywhere.
v1.64.0
   PS 07112017
   -- Made observation window observation type dependent. The common observation
      main window still can be set from the main parameter file. For a
      particular observation type it can be overwritten in the obstypes
      parameter file.
v1.63.4
   PS 01112017

      in the work directory).
v1.63.2
   PS 23102017
   -- Corrected VIIRS reader. Now PARAMETER KIND = 1 or PARAMETER KIND = 2 will
      use the nighttime or dayghlight obs only, and PARAMETER KIND = 3 will use
      all observations.
v1.63.1
   PS 19102017
   -- Added optional PARAMETER KIND to reader_viirs_standard().
v1.63.0

   -- Added reader_xyz_scattered.c.
v1.62.2
   PS 27092017
   -- Fixed (hopefully) a subtle defect in handling periodic grids. It
      manifested in getting weird longitude values for super-observations when
      the collated obs had fi (fractional i indices) both in [ni - 1, ni - 0.5)
      and [ni - 0.5, ni) intervals.
      Thanks to Matt Chamberlain and Russ Fiedler for the bug report.
v1.62.1
   PS 26092017
   -- Added optional parameters VARSHIFT and MINDEPTH to
      reader_viirs_standard().
v1.62.0

      fields.
v1.61.6

   -- Corrected the call to MPI_Allgatherv() in ensobs.c:
      MPI_Allgatherv(das->S[my_first_iteration],...) became
      MPI_Allgatherv(MPI_IN_PLACE,...). It seems that the previous version
      started to work dogy with OpenMPI v1.10.2.
v1.61.5
   PS 14092017
   -- Removed redundant reader_aquarius.c and reader_smos.c (these data are now
      handled by reader_xy_gridded.c).
v1.61.4

      record only (for now).
v1.61.3
   PS 13092017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded() and reader_xy_scattered() to allow NaNs as
      fill values. Necessary to make it possible to use for reading SMOS data.

   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded.c to handle curvilinear grids.
v1.60.1
   PS 07062017
   -- Some minor portability related changes in hash.[ch].
v1.60.0
   PS 26052017
   -- Corrected (I hope) the sign of the bias correction in the mixed layer in
      subsurface fields. (It should be the same in H_subsurf_wsurfbias() and
      in H_surf_biased().)
v1.59.2
   PS 30032017
   -- Introduced and using now str2bool() for reading ISSURFACE entry.

v1.58.0
   PS 29032017

      file. Consider it experimental at this stage! The defaults remain
      NC-64BIT_OFFSET and no compression.
v1.57.0
   PS 29032017
   -- Changed identification of observation types. Each type now is
      characterised by its "observation kind". Currently there are two kinds
      available: "SURFACE" and "SUBSURFACE". There is no longer "ALIAS" and
      "ISSURFACE" entries for observation types.

      ONE MUST MAKE (RATHER MINOR) CHANGES TO OBSTYPES.PRM FILES WHEN UPDATING
      TO THIS VERSION.
v1.56.3

   -- Added examples/5.
v1.56.0
   PS 27032017

      allows one to add a new observation type without re-compiling the code.
      This can be useful e.g. for evaluating a new instrument (by getting an
      independent statistics for the new instrument and seeing the change in
      statistics for the old instruments).

v1.46.7
   PS 14092016
   -- Changed MAXOBSVAL from 900.0 to 9000.0 to handle atmospheric pressure
      (which can exceed 1000.0)
v1.46.6

   -- On multi-grid model - modified plog_writestatevars_direct() and
     plog_writestatevars_toassemble() to skip writing variables from grids
     other than the native one for a given pointlog (this could try to access
     nodes outside grid and generate segfaults).
v1.46.5
   PS 05092016
   - Cosmetic simplifications in distribute.c.
v1.46.4
   PS 02092016

   -- Fixed a defect in reader_aquarius.c.
v1.46.0
   PS 24082016

      functions to match the new interfaces.
v1.45.2
   PS 18082016
   -- Slightly modified update_HE() and update_Hx() to fix a once-in-a-lifetime
      round-off error occuring after writing and reading `fi' to observations.nc
      as a float.
   -- Changed `id_orig' in observations.nc to correspond to the observation
      number as read from data files rather than to the id in
      observations-orig.nc (that is, after compacting).
   -- Changed the type of fields `type', `product' and `instrument' of struct
      observation from int to short int.
v1.45.1

      when calculating ensemble spread only.
v1.45.0
   PS 16082016

      running PREP and CALC).
v1.44.6
   PS 22072016
   -- Updated ncw.[ch] to ncw-c v1.02.
v1.44.5

      outside the grid.
v1.44.0
   PS 28062016
   -- Added `model_depth' to `struct observation'.
v1.43.0
   PS 28062016
   -- Minor structural changes for struct obstype -- now can depend on an
      arbitrary number of model variables specified after the entry VAR in
      the observation types parameter file. The entry VAR2 is now redundant.
v1.42.1
   PS 22062016
   -- Further changes for the case -DZSIGN_NOCHECK.
v1.42.0
   PS 22062016

      handled correctly.
v1.40.2
   PS 17062016
   -- Added "|NETCDF_FORMAT" when creating observations*.nc files to allow

v1.37.1
   PS 12042016
   -- Fixed analysis variable names in pointlog files: they now have suffix
      suffix "_an" if ehkf_update outputs analyses, and "inc" if it outputs
      increments (before it was "_an" regardless).
v1.37.0
   PS 24032016

   PS 11032016
   -- Made sure that in single observation experiments (options
      --single-observation-xyz or --single-observation-ijk of enkf_calc) for
      surface obs types the observation layer/depth is set to surface
      regardless of the entered value
v1.33.0
   PS 03032016
   -- Adding parameter "ADD" to the RADS reader to make it possible to revert
      a correction to SLA
v1.32.4
   PS 20022016

v1.32.3
   PS 17022016
   -- Added examples/4 to demonstrate a multi-grid setting.
   -- Added examples/1/conf directory to the source. Excluded it from the

      set aas curvilinear (although in fact it is rectangular in lon/lat).
v1.32.0
   PS 12022016
   Made changes in the grid code to enable handling of ORCA grids. Also
   simplified the structure of the grid code -- got rid of dynamic functions,
   now using simple "if" cycles instead. Added grid_ij2xy() to make it possible
   to get cell's coordinates when necessary without parsing the whole grid into
   a spatial binary tree.

   In regard ORCA grids the workflow is as follows.
   1. Make a complementary grid with masked nodes around two poles in the
      northern hemisphere and along the line connecting these nodes. Run PREP
      with this grid. It will be fully mapped at a cost that a very small
      percent of obs along the line connecting the two poles will be ignored.
   2. Run CALC and POST with the normal grid.

   PS 30112015
   -- Modified code to allow arbitrary range for the grid longitude.
      The range is now defined by the grid.lonbase field:
      lon range = [lonbase, lonbase + 360). (Used to be allowed either
      [-180, 180) or [0, 360) only.)
v1.28.3

v1.26.11
   PS 26102015
   -- Allowed comments (starting with "#") after definition of pointlog in the

   -- Corrected a (recently introduced) defect in g2_xy2fij() that filtered
      latitude according to the longitude range (-180 to 180 or 0 to 360).

      parameter MINDEPTH.
v1.22
   PS 07092015
   -- in find_files() added fflush(stdout) before calling popen() to avoid
      "intermingling" of outputs of the original and fork processes.
   -- Added a section on adaptive moderation of observations ("K-factor") to
      user manual.
v1.21.1
   PS 04092015
   -- Changed default to ignore subgrid variability.
v1.21
   PS 04092015
   -- During superobing - calculate std of the subgrid variability (in a rather
      crude way) and use <obs error std> = max(<obs error std>, <subgrid std>).
v1.20
   PS 03092015
   -- Switched off writing obs to observations-orig.nc when enkf_prep is run
      with --no-superobing.
   -- Corrected indexing of obs. This might be a substantial defect that was
      demonstrated to result in losing superobs in some cases, at least.
v1.19.2
   PS 01092015
   -- Fixed inconsistency in handling pointlog hash table.
v1.19.1
   PS 01092015
   -- A number of minor follow-on changes to v1.19.
v1.19
   PS 31082015
   -- Modified code to allow point logs to be specified on any grid by entering
      the grid name as an additional parameter in the pointlog entry. Grid 0
      will still be used as default.
v1.18
   PS 31082015
   -- Verified that setting LOCRAD and STRIDE to big numbers results in
      calculating a global analysis. Made some changes to the code to ensure
      that it runs with such setings, even when using more than one CPU in calc.
      Added target "global" to example 1.
v1.17
   PS 27082015
   -- Made writing analyses to separate files (rather than appending to forecast
      files) the default action. The former option "--separate-output" became
      redundant, a new option "--joint-analysis" appends analysis to forecast
      files.
v1.16
   PS 26082015
   -- Fixed a defect for sigma models resulted only in the first (with zero id)
      layer being updated (not sure when it was introduced).
v1.15
   PS 26082015
   -- Added a check on analysis julian day when opening observations.nc (to
      exclude using data from another cycle).
v1.14
   PS 25082015
   -- Added option "--point-logs-only" to enkf_calc to complement
      "--no-fields-write" in enkf_update.
v1.13
   PS 18082015
   -- Introduced global z intervals used for each region (unless overriden
      by local settings). Also, if no regions defined introduced a default
      region "Global" with domain [x1,x2] = [-999,999], [y1,y2] = [-999,999].
v1.12
   PS 17082015
   -- Can now specify arbitrary number of z intervals for obs stats of 3D
      fields for each region. The default is [0 50] [50 500] [500 9999].
v1.11
   PS 13082015
   -- Added ability to specify vertical split in observation stats for 3D fields
      for each region (in the region specs in the main parameter file); also
      added stats for the intermediate interval.
v1.10
   PS 12082015
   -- Fixed a major slowdown in obs_findlocal() introduced in v1.08: moved
      obs_find_bytype() outside.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the report.
v1.09.1
   PS 07082015
   -- Fixed bug in invsqrtm2() that resulted in wrong X5 for the ETKF.
      Thanks to Yonghong Yin for the report.
v1.09
   PS 04082015
   -- Added a new flag "--use-rmsd-for-obsstats" for enkf_calc. When RMSD is
      printed to the log, "[.]" is shown instead of "|.|" used for printing
      MAD. Also, added printing of the command line and working directory to the
      log for all binaries.
v1.08.2
   PS 03082015
   -- Corrected bug in obs_findlocal().
v1.08.1
   PS 03082015
   -- Bugs corrected in das_writefields() and obs_addtype().
v1.08
   PS 03082015
   -- Modified code to make localisation radius dependent on the observation
      type. The common value can now be overriden for  particular obs. type
      in the observation types parameter file.
v1.07
   PS 29072015
   -- Added a new option to enkf_update: --write-inflation. (It only takes
      effect when using adaptive inflation.)
v1.06.1
   PS 23072015
   -- Fixed a defect -- checking that plogs do actually exist before working
      on them.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for reporting.
v1.06
   PS 22072015
   -- Added capability to define the limiting multiple for inflation (remains
      0.5 by default).
v1.05
   PS 09072015
   -- Added AMSRE reader.
v1.04
   PS 09072015
   -- Eliminated the field `dasystem.target'; it is replaced by the flag
      `das->updatespec & UPDATE_OUTPUTINC'.
v1.03
   PS 08072015
   -- Unified specifications for enkf_update -- they are now all in the variable
      `updatespec'.
   -- Introduced a new option in enkf_update "-no-fields-update".
v1.02
   PS 22062015
   -- Made land test in das_updatefields() and das_updatebg() depth dependent.
      For now assume that the layeres are counted down from the surface (for Z
      models).
v1.01
   PS 18062015
   -- Fixed inconsistency with -DNO_GRIDUTILS.
      Thanks to Russ Fiedler for the bug report.
   -- Some cosmetic changes.
v1.00
   PS 17062015
   -- Modified code to make the actual (interpolated) transforms/weights also
      written to the pointlog files (as "X5_actual" or "w_actual").
v0.99
   PS 16062015
   -- Modified pointlog code to write both analysis and forecast variables (was
      analysis only).
   -- Corrrected spread calculation (replaced /(m-1) by /m).
   -- Changed sprintf() to snprintf() throughout the code.
v0.98
   PS 03062015
   -- Fixed a (minor) inconsistency that led to assertion failure in some
      single observation experiments.
v0.97.3
   PS 11052015
   -- Corrected a defect in utils.c: replaced "sort_r()" by "qsort_r()" to
      compile correctly for systems with no qsort_r().
v0.97.2
   PS 08052015
   -- Added a new procedure utils.c::int getnumlevels(char fname[], char
      varname[]) and use it in H_surf_standard() to test whether the model file
      has been stripped to contain the surface layer only or not. (This is
      necessary when the top layer is not k = 0.)
   -- Added a few assertions to readfield() and writefield().
v0.97.1
   PS 06052015
   -- Added parameter `hastosucceed' to model_getvarid().
v0.97
   PS 05052015
   -- Set quit function for gridutils to enkf_quit. This change requires
      upgrade to the latest version of libgu (v0.54).
v0.96.3
   PS 05052015
   -- Fixed a defect in gridprm.c that sometimes caused exiting with error
      "VTYPE specified twice".
v0.96.2
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v0.96.1
   PS 19022015
   -- Fixed name of the "nk" dimension in pointlog files, get_nkname().
v0.96
   PS 17022015
   -- Fixed the call to grid_create() in model.c to pass correctly the grid type
      to the grid structure (was defaulted to GRIDVTYPE_Z).
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v0.95
   PS 12022015
   -- Modified code to be able to proceed with nobs = 0; introduced a new option
      for enkf_calc "--ignore-no-obs".
v0.94
   PS 05022015
   -- Added code for qsort_r() activated by compiler flag -DNO_QSORT_R. (For
      systems with old glibc; based on public code sort_r.h by Isaac Turner.)
v0.93
   Paul Sandery 30012015
   -- Added a reader for AMSR-2.
v0.92.3
   PS 30012015
   -- Corrected das_updatebg() to work in the case STRIDE = 1.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v0.92.2
   PS 16012015
   -- Modified H_surf_standard() and H_surf_biased() to read the actual level
      of the surface variable.
v0.92.1
   PS 16012015
   -- Made DEPTHVARNAME optional for a grid; an error is generated in
      model_getdepth() if it is not set for the grid the variable is defined on.
   -- Made the inflation limited by half of the magnitude of the spread
      reduction.
v0.92
   PS 06012015
   -- Added a strict check on keywords in obstypes parameter file. Corrected
      obstypes parameter file in example 1 (replaced MIN and MAX by MINVALUE and
      MAXVALUE). Removed redundant explicit call to das_setobstypes() in
      enkf_calc.c made in the case of singleob.
   -- Corrected handling of obs error from file in obs_add().
   -- Made a few changes towards achieving consistency in handling grid
      periodicity. Affected interpolate2d(), interpolate3d(), grid_xy2fij().
   -- Do not calculate transforms for a grid in das_calctransforms() if there
      are no model variable associated with it.
   -- Corrected das_updatefields() to work in the case STRIDE = 1.
v0.91
   PS 12122014
   -- Structural changes: no more `models' directory. Instead, grid
      specifications now require VTYPE (currently can be either "z" or "sigma").
v0.90
   PS 17122014
   -- Corrected defect in verticall mapping.
      Thanks to Russ Fiedler for the bug report.
   -- Moved `gridprm' stuff to gridprm.[ch].
v0.89
   PS 10122014
   -- Added sigma model to enable assimilating with ROMS. Quite substantial
      secondary changes overall.
v0.88
   PS 20141120
   -- SUBSTANTIAL structural changes. It is now possible to have multiple grids
      within a model. Each variable is associated with one of the grids. The
      ensemble transforms are calculated separately for each grid. Analysed
      ensembles in pointlogs are produced with the transforms on the grid
      defined first in the grid parameter file, for now.
   -- A correction for the CARS reader: an obs is considered invalid if its
      depth is < 0.
v0.87
   PS 20141114
   -- Replaced SRF limited inflation by inflation limited by directly calculated
      spread reduction for each element of the state vector. This is a default
      inflation mode; add PLAIN to the inflation specification in the parameter
      file to use uniform inflation.
v0.86
   PS 20141110
   -- The variable-specific inflation set in the model parameter file now simply
      overrides (not multiplies with) the common inflation set in the main
      parameter file.
v0.85
   PS 20141103
   -- Added RADS reader "biased" for MDT bias correction with the EnKF.
   -- Modified format of H_fn: added varname2 to specify for the bias variable
      when necessary.
   -- Corrected a minor interpolation bug introduced in previous version in
      das_updatefields().
   -- Corrected interpolation bug in fi2x().
v0.84
   PS 20141024
   -- in das_updatefields() limited inflation by 1 + SRF.
v0.83
   PS 20141013
   -- Added a new parameter "--no-superobing" to enkf_prep.
v0.82
   PS 20141010
   -- Fixed a defect in update_HE() that might cause accessing observation
      array element outside the array.
v0.81
   PS 20141008
   -- Modified das_calcbatchstats() to run only on master.
v0.80
   PS 20141003
   -- Corrected a defect in obs_markbadbatches() when a batch of wrong type
      could be used.
v0.79
   PS 20140919 (minor changes)
   -- Made it possible to compile without `gridutils' by defining flag
      -DNO_GRIDUTILS
v0.78
   PS 20140919 (minor changes)
   -- Set batch ID for NAVO and Windsat SST obs to 0 (was -1). This makes it
      possible to identify "bad batches" of these obs on "per file" basis.
v0.77
   PS 20140909 (moderate structural changes)
   -- Introduced `struct variable'.
   -- Changed the way the custom model initialisation is done: now it is called
      right after reading the model type; this allows to read other bits in the
      model parameter file in a custom way.
   -- Removed now redundant `struct zmodelprm' in zmodel.c. Added
      zmodel_adddata().
   -- Now read WM__INST_TYPE in MMT reader as the instrument type.
   -- Removed redudant variable `vv' in das_updatefields().
   -- Modified definition of das_updatefields() to make it more general and
      more consistent with other update procedures.
v0.76
   PS 20140901
   -- Renamed stage 3 from "post" to "update".
v0.75
   PS 20140828
   -- Introduced field `alloctype' in `modeldata' to handle de-allocation.
   -- Made the parameter `nk' in
      model_getdims(model* m, int* ni, int* nj, int* nk) optional (can be NULL
      if not needed).
v0.74
   PS 28082014
   -- Moved specification of variables from main parameter file to model
      parameter file.
   -- Modified entry for model data: it now should start with "DATA".
v0.73
   PS 27082014
   -- Reduced number of tiles for point logs by joining tiles for the same
      field for all point logs into one.
v0.72
   PS 26082014
   -- Made writing state variables to point log files two-stage, similar
      to other updates: first to tiles, one cpu per tile, and then the final
      "assembly". Added plog_writestatevars_toassemble() and
      plog_assemblestatevars(); plog_writestatevars() became
      plog_writestatevars_direct().
v0.71
   PS 20082014
   -- Made structural changes: put observation type related stuff into
      obstypes.[ch]. Introduced new "observation types" parameter file.
      Eliminated `struct obstypedesc' and global variable `obstypedesc
      otdescs[]'. Consolidated all obs type related stuff in
      observations.obstypes field. Moved all obs types related stuff from
      enkfprm_read() to obstypes_read().
   -- Added descriptions of each parameter file used; modified usage to reflect
      this.
   -- Modified obs_add() to report the number of good obs read from each data
      file (along with the total number of obs). Removed this from CARS and
      MMT readers (no longer needed).
   -- In example 1 added a new target "singleob".
v0.70
   PS 18082014
   -- Fixed a silly defect in das_writefields_toassemble() (an unecessary cycle
      over ensemble).
v0.69
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced obs_checkdatasize() and put it into readers.
v0.68
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced option to specify domains for each type of observations by
      entries "OBSDOMAIN <obs type> <x1> <x2> <y1> <y2> [<z1> <z2>]" in the
      parameter file.
   -- For RADS reader in Neil White's format - only use obs with local_flag = 0.
v0.67
   PS 14082014
   -- Made a modification: the entries for standard deviations optionally
      specified in each section of the observation parameter file can now
      also specify the associated arithmetic operation: EQUAL (default),
      PLUS (actually sqrt(std * std + prev * prev)), MULT, MIN, MAX
v0.66
   PS 13082014
   -- Made a small correction in readers.
   -- Merged das_create() for calc and post. Added creation of pointlogs for
      post.
   -- Swapped dimensions for S in plog_write().
   -- Introduced field `struct observation.nallocated'.
v0.65
   PS 09082014
   -- Eliminated potentially architechture dependent operations with floating
      point in distribute_iterations().
v0.64
   PS 08082014
   -- Removed exit by error in distribute_iterations() in the case when the
      number of iterations is less than the number of CPUs. Seems to work fine.
   -- Replaced enkf_calc.c::int fstatsonly by global.c::int enkf_fstatsonly.
   -- Added a new target "stats" to example/1.
v0.63
   PS 06082014
   -- Removed field `dasystem.Hx'.
v0.62
   PS 06082014
   -- Replaced  NC_CLOBBER by NC_CLOBBER | NC_64BIT_OFFSET.
v0.61
   PS 05082014
   -- Added consistency to standardising/destandardising/sorting/unsorting obs.
      Fixed inconsistencies introduced in v0.60.
v0.60
   PS 05082014
   -- Bug fix in das_calcinnandspread().
v0.59
   PS 04082014
   -- Replicated using STATUS_ROUNDUP in interpolate_3d_obs() (was only in
      interpolate_2d_obs() ).
v0.58
   PS 04082014
   -- Rewrote unsortobs_byij() in an economical way, avoiding duplication of S.
v0.57
   PS 01082014
   -- Modified das_destandardise() to include restoring obs order by id.
      Simplified das_printobsstats(), das_printfobsstats(dasystem* das)
      and das_calcbatchstats() accordingly.
   -- Added obs_inorder().
   -- Minor fixes.
v0.56
   PS 23072014
   -- A defect in enkf_calc.c (using destroyed object)
v0.55
   PS 23072014
   -- Miscellaneous changes: batch identification, hashtable, MMT reader...
v0.54
   PS 22072014
   -- Introduces STATUS_ROUNDUP for the cases when the observation changes
      grid cell after its fractional indices are written and read from
      observations.nc
v0.53
   PS 15072014
   -- Adding another parameter for entry BADBATCHES - threshold batch mean
      absolute innovation.
v0.52
   PS 14072014
   -- Setting SOBSTRIDE = 0 now switches superobing off.
v0.51
   PS 11072014 Added functionality to detect and remove bad batches of obs:
   -- Makefile: introduced flags -DENKF_PREP, -DENKF_CALC, -DENKF_POST when
      compiling enkf_prep, enkf_calc and enkf_post; added hash.h and hash.c;
      updated file lists
   -- enkf_prep: introduced new option --print-batchstats
   -- enkf_prep: marks as bad observations from batches listed in
      "badbatches.out"
   -- added fields `nbadbatchspecs' and `badbatchspecs' to `struct enkfprm' and
      `struct dasystem'
   -- obsstats.c: added das_calcbatchstats()
   -- lots of small changes elsewhere to handle batches
v0.50
   PS 09072014

   PS 27062014
   -- Added H_sla_bran() that conducts global debiasing of SLA innovation.
v0.47
   PS 26062014
   -- A bit of generalisation on coordinates: added grid_settocartesian_fn()
      and grid_tocartesian(); made the associated changes in the rest of the
      code.
v0.46
   PS 26062014
   Quite a bit of structural change. Some of the parameter files are affected.

      [-180, 180] or [0, 360] range and adjust observations accordingly.
   -- Changed model->depth from double** to float**.
   -- Modified model_z2k(): it now checks that the observation depth is smaller
      than the model depth.
v0.44
   PS 19052014
   -- Added new scheme EnKF-N
   -- Filtered out (by default) obs outside model grid in obs readers now, not
      during writing obs to files.
v0.43
   PS 14052014
   -- Consolidated tiles for the EnKF in per variable/per layer files. That
      is, one tile now holds the whole ensemble. Fixed defects in detecting
      tiles. Removed WRITEBG_BYMASTER pre-processor flag.
v0.42
   PS 09052014
   -- Remove tiles by default, add a new command option --leave-tiles to post
      to leave tiles

      the value, but also: lon, lat, depth, fi, fj, fk, date
   -- Introduced a new option "--no-mean-update" for enkf_calc.
v0.38
   PS 27022014
   -- Reshuffle of writing the output by post: now by default it writes analysed
      2D fields to individual files, and then assemble those into final
      analysis files. Use --direct-write option to post to force the direct
      write
v0.37
   PS 21022014
   Bug fix: inflation was not applied properly when running with
   --out-increment in enkf_post.
v0.36
   PS 15022014
   -- Introduced a new command line option "--describe-prm-format"
   -- Eliminated pre-processor flag CONSERVATIVE_Z2K (assumed always false now).
v0.35
   PS 20122013
   -- Changed options style from "-x" to "--do-that".
   -- Removed utility "mkunitobs", introduced two new options for enkf_calc
      "--single-observation-xyz" and "--single-observation-ijk" instead.
   -- Replaced pre-processor flag SEPARATE_STORAGE by a new option for
      enkf_post "separate-output"

      the z2k transformations in partially watered cell are assumed to be
      not valid.

      information whether observations of this type are surface or subsurface.
   -- Added a new field "id_orig" to type "measurement".
   -- Changed MPI send/receive for HE from blocking to asynchronous to avoid a
      bottleneck for very large models.
   -- Added compile flag HE_VIAFILE to communicate HE via a NetCDF file.
v0.33
   PS 27112013
   -- Introduced ENSOBSTYPE for ensemble observations (was double), to save
      memory for very big systems.
v0.32
   PS 15112013
   -- Added reporting stats for individual instruments by das_printobsstats()
      and das_printfobsstats().
   -- Moved update procedures from dasystem.c into update.c to reduce the
      size of dasystem.c.
   -- ditto transform.c
   -- ditto obsstats.c
   -- ditto ensobs.c
   -- Conducted a bit of Makefile restructuring, moving stuff from COMMON to
      CALC and POST
   -- Added a command-line utility `mkunitobs' that creates observations.nc
      with a single observation of specified type, innovation and error
v0.31
   PS 04112013
   -- Added SCHEME = ETKF (DEnKF remains the default) for MODE = EnKF.
   -- observations-orig.nc: excluding observations with status = STATUS_OUTSIDE;
      use "enkf_prep -a ..." to put all obs.
v0.30
   PS 18102013
   Added a pre-processor option SEPARATE_STORAGE to split forecast and analysis
   into different files. The analysis file name is created by appending
   ".analysis" to the forecast file name.
v0.29
   PS 14102013
   Implemented point logs.
v0.28
   PS 26092013
   Added option -s to enkf_post to calculate the ensemble spread and write to
   "spread.nc".
v0.27
   PS 12092013
   Added backtrace() in enkf_quit().
   Added a pre-processor option WRITEBG_BYMASTER to update BG fields by all
   processes or by master only.
v0.26
   Paul Sandery 4/9/2013
   Added reading profiles in BoM's MMT format.
v0.25
   PS 22/8/2013
   Added option -s to enkf_calc to calculate forecast observation stats only.
   This cuts (for EnOI) reading the ensemble and calculating transforms.
v0.24
   PS 19/8/2013
   Modified das_writebg() to pass all writing to the master.
v0.23
   PS 31/7/2013
   Changed return values for model_getmemberfnameasync_fn and
   model_getbgfnameasync_fn from void to int. These functions are supposed
   to return 0 or 1 depending on whether the asynchronous data were found (1)
   or not (0).
   Modified writefield() to handle "missing_value" atribute for NC_FLOAT.
   Modified das_printobsstats() to print stats by day for asynchronous obs.
v0.22
   PS 11/7/2013
   Modified writefield() to handle "valid_range" attribute for data of type
   NC_FLOAT.
v0.21
   PS 5/7/2013
   Added curvilinear capability for MOM. Was not able to test.
v0.20
   PS 15/5/2013
   Added file headers
v0.18
   PS 10/5/2013
   Added `scale_factor' and `add_offset' to readfield().
v0.17
   PS 10/4/2013
   Added "indent" target to the Makefile.
v0.16
   PS 8/4/2013
   Fixed defect in distribute_iterations().
v0.15
   PS 5/4/2013
   Fixed inconsistency between distribute_iterations() and
   das_calculatetransforms().
v0.14
   PS 5/4/2013
   For all readers - handle the case of # obs. = 0.
