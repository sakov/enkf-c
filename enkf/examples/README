Example 1: 

  A basic example created from snapshots of EnKF and EnOI systems for Tasman
  Sea. The targets demonstrate different capabilities of EnKF-C:
    enkf -- assimilation with the EnKF
    enoi -- assimilation with the EnOI
    stats -- calculation of innovation statistics without assimilation
    singleob -- single observation experiment
    global -- global analysis with the EnKF
    pointlogs -- obtaining full information about assimilation at a specific
      location (without re-calculating the analysis)
  See 1/README for more details.

  Downloading data for example 1 is prerequisite for running examples 2-4.

Example 2:

  As example 1, but demonstrates using curvilinear rather than a rectangular
  grid in lon/lat. (Although the actual grid is the same as in example 1.)

Example 3:

  Demonstrates using partially masked curvilinear grid in PREP. This may be
  necessary to handle topologically screwed grids, e.g. tri-polar ORCA grids.

Example 4:

  Demonstrates a multi-grid setting.
