This is an example for the EnKF-C package. It has been put up based on the runs
of regional EnKF and EnOI reanalysis systems for Tasman Sea developed by Bureau
of Meteorology. It allows one to conduct a single assimilation for 23 December 
2007 (day 6565 since 1 January 1990) with either EnKF or EnOI.

Note that to reduce the example size 
(1) the grid has been reduced to 100 x 100 x 2
(2) global ESACCI SST observations has been cut to regional observations only

Because of (1) assimilation of subsurface observations (TEM and SAL observation
types) is sort of funny, but is OK for testing purposes.

enkf_calc and enkf_post are run on NP_CALC and NP_UPDATE CPUs (2 by default) --
edit Makefile to change these settings.

Examine Makefile to understand what happens and how for each particular target.

PREREQUISITES

1. To run this example you need to download example1-data-v2.tar.gz (69 MB) from

https://github.com/sakov/enkf-c/releases/download/data/example1-data-v2.tar.gz

and unpack in this directory.

2. Compile EnKF-C.

3. You may wish to adjust NP_CALC and NP_UPDATE in Makefile according to the 
number of cores on your machine.

TESTING ENKF

To assimilate with the EnKF, run "make enkf".
The analysed ensemble members will be of the form 
ensemble_6565/mem<num>_<var>.nc.analysis, where <num> is the member id, between
001 and 096, and <var> is one of the state variables: eta_t, temp, salt, u or v.
Also, the following auxiliary files will be created:
  -- observation.nc - full information in observation space (for
     superobservations)
  -- obervations-orig.nc - original observations
  -- transforms.nc - 2D array of ensemble transforms T (EnKF) and coefficients
     w (EnKF and EnOI) -- see sec. 3.3 of the User Guide.
  -- enkf_diag.nc - data on observation impact
  -- inflation.nc - the actual inflation for each state element
  -- spread.nc - ensemble spread
  -- prep.out, calc.out, update.out - log files
  -- pointlog_156.000,-32.000.nc - full information about state and analysis in point
     (lon, lat) = (156.0, -32.0)

TESTING ENOI

To assimilate with the EnOI, run "make enoi". The analysis will be of the form
background/bg_<var>.nc.analysis. Also, auxiliary files similar those for the
EnKF will be created except X5.nc, which is preplaced by w.nc - 2D array of
update coefficients.

TESTING MODEL VALIDATION

Testing using EnKF-C for for validating a model against observations only, 
without data assimilation, run "make stats". The innovation statistics will be
printed to the log of enkf_calc.

TESTING SINGLE OBSERVATION EXPERIMENT

Run "make singleob". The results are in background_6565/*.increment.

TESTING GENERATION OF ADDITIONAL POINTLOG FILES

The idea is that if something goes wrong with DA at particular locations, one
can add point logs at these locations in the main parameter file and re-run
enkf_calc and enkf_post "cheaply" (without re-calculating transforms for the
whole grid and re-updating the analysis) and investigate what happened.

Run "make enkf", then "make pointlogs" to add a couple of additional point logs
in locations (152.0, -36.0) and (160.0, -29.0).

TESTING GLOBAL ENKF ANALYSIS

Setting "LOCRAD 1e6" and "STRIDE 999999" effectively results in conducting a
global analysis. Run "make global" to test.

TESTING HYBRID covariance.

Run "make hybrid".

--

To clean up the analysis, run "make clean".

Apart from the EnKF/EnOI analyses, a number of auxiliary files are generated:

prep.out - log file from enkf_prep
calc.out - log file from enkf_calc
post.out - log file from enkf_post
observations.nc - pre-processed superobservations
observations-orig-nc - pre-processed original observations
enkf_diag.nc - observation impact file
X5.nc - 2D array of local ensemble transforms (EnKF)
w.nc - 2D array of local ensemble linear combination coefficients (EnOI)
spread.nc - spread of the corresponding ensemble
pointlog_156.000,-32.000.nc -- point log with exaustive DA information for
location (lon,lat) = (156,-32)
inflation.nc -- inflation used for each state element
pointlog_152.000,-36.000.nc, pointlog_160.000,-29.000.nc -- two additional
point logs generated when running "make pointlogs"

If you suspect that something went wrong, you may compare your logs with those
in the "logs" directory.

NOTE: the 2-layer setting used has middle layer depths of 2.5 m and 
255.8842 m. EnKF-C assumes the top layer thickness of 5 m and bottom layer 
thickness of (255.8842 - 5) * 2 = 501.7684 m. This settings are used for demo
purposes only; the actual model layer at 255m has upper and lower boundaries
at 242.6595 and 269.109 m. For this reason and because of the vertical
interpolation between layers to the depth of super observations the results of
assimilating in-situ T and S can not be expected to be physically sensible.


Have fun,
