This is an example with an unstructured grid. It has been put up as a code test
only, with not much physical sense. The initial ensemble is constructed from 19
consequitive daily average dumps from COMPAS model developed by CSIRO. The
background is a reduced restart from COMPAS with basic model variables only.
The grid data file contains a couple of additional variables necessary for
the grid handling: triangles_t, neighbours_t, triangles_c, and neighbours_c.
These can be output by COMPAS, but in the example were constructed using
separate triangulation software.

Note that CALC is quite slow because the transforms are calculated for each grid
node (without striding).
