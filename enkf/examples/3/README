This is example 3 for the EnKF-C package. It is based on example 1 and has been
put up to demonstrate using partially masked curvilinear grid in PREP, while
using full grid in CALC and UPDATE. This may be needed for handling
topologically screwed grids, e.g. tri-polar ORCA grids.

PREREQUISITES

Set up example 1 as described in ../1/README.

TESTING ENKF

To assimilate with the EnKF, run "make enkf".
The analysed ensemble members will be of the form 
ensemble_6565/mem<num>_<var>.nc.analysis, where <num> is the member id, between
001 and 096, and <var> is one of the state variables: eta_t, temp, salt, u or v.

TESTING ENOI

To assimilate with the EnOI, run "make enoi". The analysis will be of the form
background/bg_<var>.nc.analysis.
